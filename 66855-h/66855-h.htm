  <h2 class='c006'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The magazine, <i>Time</i>, commenting on my new book, <i>The
Psychology of Music</i><a id='rA' /><a href='#fA' class='c008'><sup>[A]</sup></a>, spoke approvingly of the scientific contributions
to music, but gibed that, "psychologists have not explained
why we love music." As a reply to that I wrote a note, <i>Why Do
We Love Music?</i><a id='rB' /><a href='#fB' class='c008'><sup>[B]</sup></a> This seemed to call for a wider excursion implementing
the views there taken, as in the present Chapter I.
That, in turn, led to the writing of the remainder of this volume,
in which each chapter deals with some of the salient factors involved
in the development of feeling for music.</p>

<p class='c000'>These ventures digress from my habitual style of writing, as a
technical psychologist, in that I frequently indulge in generalizations
and predictions in a practical and popular vein. The attempt
to interpret and evaluate present tendencies in the region of
forward movements in music naturally takes me into unexplored
territory and will stimulate questioning on the part of promoters
of various interest in the field. I hold no brief for infallibility of
the positions taken, except to say that they are my convictions
at the present moment. While they are not direct reports of
scientific experiments in the laboratory or the studio, they may
be regarded as an extension or interpretation based upon scientific
experiments and observations. It is hoped that they may serve
as hypotheses or at least a challenge for investigation and practical
trial. The reader must judge what is new and what is true
from his point of view. Many of the things I advocate are in an
experimental stage and in advance of current prevailing practice.
This is the reason for presenting them. My aim has been to tease
out those elements in the musical situation which help to make
music function in our lives and be appreciated.</p>

<p class='c000'>The following chapters have appeared in magazines: Ch. I,
<i>The Etude</i> (brief summary); Ch. II, <i>The Parents' Magazine</i>;
Ch. III, <i>National Parent Teacher</i>, under the title, "On Their
Musical Way"; Ch. IV, <i>The School Review</i>; Ch. VI, <i>The Scientific
Monthly</i>. For permission to bring these chapters into this
volume I herewith express my appreciation to the publishers.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_1'>1</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Chapter I</i><br />WHY DO WE LOVE MUSIC?</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Why does a person love his sweetheart, his food, his safety,
his social fellowship, his communion with nature, his God,
approaches to the ultimate goals of truth, goodness, and beauty?
The answer to each of these is a long story, involving not only
common sense and scientific observation but a profound intuitive
insight, a self-revelation. In all, it will be found that love is a favorable
response, a reaching out for the satisfaction of a fundamental
human need, an effort to secure possession, and a willingness to
give an equivalent, indeed a more or less unconditional surrender.</p>

<p class='c014'>In all efforts to describe and explain, we reach out for specific
reasons or at least rationalizations. Modern science has made
great strides in revealing and describing all sorts of reasons for
such emotional experience and behavior. The theory of the evolution
of man, the anthropological implementation of this in the
history of the rise of mankind, the psychology of the mental
development of the individual, the comparison of this with animal
behavior, and the inspired interpretation of these motives in
literature, especially biography, autobiography, and poetry, are
sources to be drawn upon. We have the adage that the explanation
of one blade of grass involves the explanation of all the forces of
nature. This aphorism certainly applies in the attempt to explain
any particular human love.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is therefore evident that any attempt to account for a
specific affection, such as the love of music, must be fractionated,
placing responsibility in turn upon the scientist, the artist, and the
self-revelation of the inspired music lover at each culture level. It
has become the recognized function of the psychology of music to
integrate the contributions from all scientific sources, such as
anatomy, physiology, anthropology, acoustics, mental hygiene, and
logic, in their bearings upon the hearing of music, the appreciation
of music, musical skills, theories, and influences. To account for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>the emotional power of music, the psychologist must consider the
taproots of the artistic nature of the individual in relation to the
nature of the art object, music. He must trace the unfolding of
the organism as a whole from inherited reflexes, instincts, urges,
drives, and capacities in an integrated pattern; he must consider
the function of the art in human economy and especially the goals
attained by the pursuit of the art. In this task there is room for
intricate specializations and division of labor. It is my purpose
here to present merely a rough skeletal outline of some of the
outstanding features which underlie the love of music from the
psychological point of view.</p>

<p class='c014'>Every impulse has two aspects: attraction and repulsion. All
of us love music in some degree; all of us hate some music; and
most of us in the economy of nature are comparatively indifferent
and extravagantly wasteful to the role that music might play in
our lives. Hatred and indifference to music are important realities
in life worthy of serious consideration; but our topic restricts us
to the positive side of musical response, the love of music.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE MUSICAL MEDIUM</h3>

<p class='c016'><i>Organic response.</i> Man is born with a psychophysical organism
which registers sounds and responds to them somewhat like a
resonator, which selects, amplifies and aids in the integration of
auditory impressions. Our whole organism responds to sound
involving the central and peripheral nervous system, all the
muscles, all the internal organs, and especially the automatic
nervous system with its endocrines, which furnish the triggers in
the physical generation of emotion. Experiments from various
sources have shown that sound acts physiologically on nervous
control, circulation, digestion, metabolism, body temperature,
posture and balance, hunger and thirst, and in general, the groundwork
of pleasure and pain. The physical organism as a whole
responds to sounds in specialized functions.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus, man comes into the world tuned to music. The organism
responds to sounds from earliest infancy. Back of all conscious
awareness, back of all musical feeling, even back of subconscious
assimilations and elaborations is the purely physiological response
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>which is a function and a condition of well-being. This physiologically
beneficent response of the organism to sound underlies
all musical experience; without it we could not love music.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Sounds in themselves.</i> Like colors, sounds may be beautiful
in themselves, quite apart from music. A single sound in nature or
art is capable of appearing in endless variety in terms of pitch,
dynamic value, duration, tone quality, and noise. It may be an
object of beauty in itself in thousands of ways quite apart from
its utility in music or musical perception. We find the tonal world
in which we live full of beautiful and useful sounds which we love
because we are capable of intellectual and emotional response to
their beneficent influence. They play a large role in our feelings
of attraction and adjustment. They may be beautiful to the untutored
and intuitive mind as well as to the intellectually and
esthetically cultured mind in the same way that flowers may seem
beautiful to a child because they arouse an immediate pleasurable
feeling; and yet they are not music but merely the raw material
from which music is made. These raw materials from which the
musical structure is raised are themselves beautiful, quite apart
from musical experience or behavior. They play a large role in
the love of nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus, before the beginnings of music, primitive man responded
affectionately to the sounds of nature and was guided by
them in his daily life. Even before language took form, single
sounds carried meaning and gave satisfaction. Man took pleasure
in his own vocal utterances or mechanically produced sounds
which played a large role in his human economy and development.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Music proper.</i> Sounds may be woven into beautiful patterns.
This is music. We admire the melodic progressions, the rhythmic
patterns, the harmonic structure, and the qualitative modulations
in the flow of beautiful sounds. Harmony, balance, symmetry, contrast
and fusions become embodied in musical form. Here the
object of our affections is the artistic creation. The place of the
musician is quite analogous to the astronomer's feeling of the
sublime as he looks into the heavens in the light of his knowledge
of the nature and movement of heavenly bodies.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Music with words and action.</i> Much of the charm of music
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>lies in its association with words which carry the message, as in
song. The center of interest in much of the vocal art lies in the
meaning conveyed by the words where the music serves as an
artistic embellishment. This is true of the lullaby, the cowboy
song, the lover's plea, and grand opera. Likewise, much of
the charm of music lies in its association with overt action as in
dances, work songs, marches, and games, where action is rhythmic.
This added power of the music lies not only in the dance steps
but more conspicuously in the suggestive rhythms divided into
intricate patterns often far surpassing the score or the physical
performance. That is what we mean when we say music carries.
In such situations the musical appeal may lie for one person in
the verbal message or the overt action and for another, purely
in the musical appeal. Yet both words and action on the one hand
and music on the other are enriched through the association.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Symbolism.</i> Music finds its highest and most universal expression
in symbolism. Music is primarily a way of expressing moods,
attitudes, feelings, and longings in generalized form. The listener
tends to live himself concretely into the feeling suggested. In the
esthetic mood he is not aware of the mechanics of the symbolic
suggestion, for which the art has many resources, and he may not
be aware of the music as such; but he lives realistically within his
own personal realm of interests. Thus, music sounds the keynote
on great festive occasions in the powerful forms of festive music,
as in the great sacred oratorios and simpler but beautiful forms
of church music or in triumphant marches and other festive celebrations
in major form. But minor forms, as in tone poems and
haunting melodies, work on the same principle and perhaps fully
as effectively. From the grandeur suggested by the sonata to the
serenity arising from the simplest bit of improvization in voice or
instrument, music has unlimited power to seize the individual for
some form of dreamlike realization of the subjects of his longings.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>THE MUSICAL MOTIVES</h3>

<p class='c016'>What we are called upon to explain then in the attraction for
musical art is essentially the motives which drive man to the
creation, appreciation, and performance of music. One of these
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>motives is the love of knowledge as a thing in itself, the understanding
of what is, and the power of passing from vantage
ground to vantage ground in the logical creation, appreciation,
and execution of art forms.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Musical knowledge.</i> This love of music for its cognitive value
can be traced from the earliest musical achievements, as in the
growing acquaintance with song, sight reading, qualifications for
participation in music, and appreciation of art forms, throughout
all stages in the musical development of the individual up to that
of the highest interpreters and creators of music. While music is a
play on our feelings and appeals primarily to our emotional life,
an intellectual mastery of the process, the ability to understand
artistic meanings, the ability to construct beautiful art forms, the
ability to analyze elements in the power of music, the ability to
see the relation between musical art and other forms of art, and
the ability to comprehend the unity of all the arts, are basic in our
love of music. Even in the cool and logical pursuit of the science
of music, foundations are laid for the deepening of insight and
the revelation of artistic values. Glimpses into the vistas of unexplored
resources intensify the admiration, the feeling of awe,
the glimpse into the infinite which is love of the object pursued.</p>

<p class='c014'>The role of intelligence in music is well illustrated in recent
experiments in which vocabulary was measured in three groups;
namely, ten nationally well-known composers, ten of the most
successful students in a large class in composition, and ten of the
least successful students in the same class. It was found that the
master composers and the successful students of composition
ranked in or near the top in a test of general vocabulary; whereas,
the unsuccessful students ranked near the bottom. Since knowledge
of words is an index for the possession of ideas, it is
significant to note that successful composers are persons who have
a large and discriminating command of ideas.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Musical feeling.</i> It must be recognized that the love of music
is essentially an unanalyzed feeling. Countless people feel the
esthetic appeal in music without understanding anything about it.
It may be like the notorious puppy love, which is frequently blind,
but nevertheless a deep love. This is particularly true in the earlier
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>stages of the development of musical interests. But it is occasionally
in evidence in the successful singer on the stage who may
be blissfully ignorant of the principles underlying his art, the
media he seeks to mold, or the significance of his message. There
is much justification for the performer's forgetting what little he
knows and indulging in self-expression in a state of abandon in
which he deeply feels his message and expects to convey this
feeling to the listener.</p>

<p class='c014'>We must distinguish between two attitudes in listening to
music and in the performance of music: the critically analytical
and the purely emotional. An intelligent musician is capable of
both and loves both. In the learning stages he pursues the former
attitude primarily until techniques are mastered and habits are
formed which operate automatically in the musical situation. This
is also the dominant attitude of the music critic. But in seeking
the enjoyment of music and in the unified expression of a thing
beautiful, the musician takes the other attitude. Paderewski
would be hopelessly lost and ineffective if, at the moment of
performance, he should be consciously aware of all the art forms
of which he is master. The successful performance comes in an
inspirational attitude, the semi-ecstatic feeling of the beauty one
seeks to convey, a state of forgetfulness of self and concrete facts.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus music is a language of emotion. Through it the composer
and the performer convey their own emotions to the listener. It
is a message and a means of communication which enable the
performer and the listener to live for moments in the same tonal
world of pleasure. Our muse is jealous and seeks to exclude all
intruders at the moment of her artistic appeal.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Musical action.</i> On a par with the intellectual and emotional
approach is the role of action in music. Consider for a moment
the central place of rhythm. The composer presents a hierarchy
of rhythms: the measure rhythm, the phrase rhythm, the sentence
rhythm, the movement rhythm, all moving into a unified
beautiful artistic structure. The performer takes this as a cue and
adds or detracts, as the case may be, by his personal interpretation.
Modern psychology has shown that all musical listening is action,
a constructive response on the part of the listener.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>All rhythm is primarily a projection of personality. My
rhythm flows from what I am. A large part of the pleasure in
music comes from a satisfaction in what rhythm does. Rhythm
facilitates perception by grouping; rhythm adjusts the stream of
attention; rhythm gives a feeling of balance; rhythm gives a
feeling of freedom, luxury and expanse; rhythm gives a feeling
of power, it carries; rhythm, as in the dance, stimulates
and lulls, contradictory as this may seem; rhythm finds resonance
in the whole organism; rhythm arouses sustained and enriched
associations; rhythm reaches out in extraordinarily detailed complexity
with progressive mastery; the instinctive craving for
experience in rhythm results in play, which is free self-expression
for the pleasure of expression; rhythm plays not only with temporal
but also with dynamic and qualitative aspects of tone.
Subjectively, rhythm in music is a play within a play: The composer
anticipates it, the performer gives the cue, and the listener
expresses himself in it.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Music as play.</i> All art is play, and the charm of music, the
purest form of art, lies fundamentally in the fact that it furnishes
a medium of self-expression for the mere joy of expression and
without ulterior purpose. It becomes a companion in solitude, a
medium through which we can live with the rest of the world.
Through it we express our love, our fears, our sympathy, our
aspirations, our feelings of fellowship, our communion with the
Divine in the spirit of freedom of action.</p>

<p class='c014'>Note the fundamental characteristics of play and observe how
in these lies the power of attraction in music as play. Play gives
a feeling of self-realization; it is the experience of growth. It
expresses the racial life and in many respects is a reversion to
type: It has been said that we are all of the same age&mdash;millions
of years. Play is a realization of the sense of freedom; it attracts,
engages and fascinates by the very satisfaction which it engenders
and which supports it; the dance, when it is real play and not mere
social labor or conformity, carries the dancer in so far as he
falls into a state of diffuse and dreamy consciousness, intoxicated
by the sense of pleasure, lulled by the automatic rhythmic movements,
and soothed by the melodious and measured flow of music.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>Play gives satisfaction in the feeling of being a cause, of having
creative power. Play is essentially social and <a id='corr8.2'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='find'>finds</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_8.2'>finds</a></span> its highest
realization in good fellowship. Play is positive, an expression of
the joy of life. The unrestraint and spontaneity of play result in
strenuous and whole-hearted exertion; the seriousness of play is
one of its fascinations. Success in play lies in its fictitious nature;
it rests upon make believe; liberated from realities, it accepts the
ideal and lives it as real. In the possibility of playing with the
ideal lies a fundamental charm of music.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Musical imagination.</i> Music is by no means limited to what
is composed, performed and listened to in the objective situation.
Its main field of operation lies beyond the sensory impressions
and overt actions. Its principal domain is the tonal world of
memory, imagination, thought, and pure feeling. Millions of
people are today under the spell of <i>Over the Rainbow</i>, as rendered
in <i>The Wizard of Oz</i>, a simple, compelling thing which takes
possession of us in the dream, and in the humdrum of daily
activities; it lives within us realistically, quite apart from actual
sounds so long as it is novel. This is especially true of the higher
forms of art with all their intricacy and refinements in artistic
form which the trained musician can re-live or create. <i>Over the
Rainbow</i>, the expression of our freedom and self-realization in
the spirit of adventure, lies within the power of music.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Who loves music?</i> The love of music is not universal. Deep,
warm, and poised devotion to music is comparatively rare. Much
of music is plain work, sheer drudgery. Much is climbing toward
a goal never to be attained. Many who ply the art of music can
hardly be said to love it in the long run. There are aspiring artists
who devote a lifetime to the mastery of the skills, but become
hypercritical and sour when they fail to feel the esthetic glow or
gain the command of public acclaim. Many an aspiring amateur
suffers a similar defeat. To the masses, music is but fleeting incidents,
occasional whiffs of the overflow from the wealth of human
appeals to a latent artistic nature. It is a notorious fact that many
who profess a love of music do not have it, but are mere pretenders
and imitators, conscious or unconscious, and that many
who disavow it are merely dying with all their music in them.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>For such failures and inadequacies there are many possible
explanations. One of the impediments to the love of music is the
absence of the "gift", a naturally musical mind. In this there are
enormous differences in kind and degree. It follows that there
will be corresponding differences in the kind and degree of love
for music. While music springs spontaneously in the gifted child
and youth, education is as essential for music as it is for science
or language. One might as well attempt to acquire learning
without study as to acquire music without training. Then again,
as is a person's intelligence, so is his music. And creative imagination
is a tool with which music is fashioned from childhood to
the heights of artistry. Furthermore, we must recognize that for
really expressive love and devotion to music we must look to the
often justly or unjustly maligned musical temperament.</p>

<p class='c014'>Yet the company of music lovers is great. Music is the most
universal avocation. This has been true of all races throughout
all times and at all culture levels. Only a fraction of one per cent
of persons who hear music or practice it do so vocationally. We,
the people, preserve it primarily as an avocation, an activity
purely for pleasure and cultural enrichment. The love of music
abounds at our time and in our country; yet we are but at the
beginnings of a dawning musical era. The increase of leisure
time, high educational level, and the astounding invention of
instruments for the production and transmission of musical
sounds forecast its rise.</p>

<p class='c014'>Why then do we love music? Among other things we love it
because it creates a physiological well-being in our organism; it
is built from materials which are beautiful objects in themselves;
it carries us through the realms of creative imagination, thought,
actions, and feelings in limitless art forms; it is self-propelling
through natural impulses, such as rhythm; it is the language of
emotion, a generator of social fellowship; it takes us out of the
humdrum of life and makes us live in play with the ideal; it
satisfies our cravings for intellectual conquest, for isolation in the
artistic attitude of emotion, and for self-expression for the joy
of expression.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>Chapter II</i><br />MUSIC BEFORE THE AGE OF SIX</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The psychology of music and the psychology of the child are
giving us new vital conceptions of the nature and role of
music in child life. To understand this fully is to understand
adequately the nature of the child mind and the nature of music.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>From smile to music.</i> All mental development begins with
some inherited form of behavior and gradually differentiates into
richer and richer meanings and forms of expression. The taproot
of all music is the smile. This in its first appearance is a pure
reflex, expressing the well-being of the organism.</p>

<p class='c014'>Observe some typical steps in its history in high lights. When
the infant has had its fill from its mother's breast, its head falls
back and the mouth puckers as a result of withdrawal from the
nipple. The mother looks at this and says to herself, "He is satisfied."
The child has thus acquired one means of communication&mdash;the
expression of well-being. This rapidly radiates into many
situations. When the infant is patted on the back, is bathed, is
rocked in the arms, or feels the waft of comfortable air, the same
puckering of the mouth seems to convey to the mother a sign of
well-being, and the meaning of this puckering is thus enriched.</p>

<p class='c014'>It gradually radiates from the lips through more general expressions
of comfort in the face as a whole, and we have a clearly
developed smile. Gradually it becomes associated with sounds&mdash;inceptive
gurgling, simple droning, light chatter, and other inceptive
forms of vocalization, always accompanied with a smile,
which thus develops new meanings, and mother and child acquire
mutual understandings, because from the first the mother tends to
respond sympathetically in like language.</p>

<p class='c014'>As this association grows it takes the form of audible laughter
which, at a comparatively high stage of development, becomes a
"ha-ha-ha" with musical inflections. This is a form of language,
still not expressing specific ideas, but the general attitudes of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>well-being, comfort, satisfaction of young life as a whole. The mother
knows it, loves it, and responds accordingly; and this mother's
response draws from the infant a growing hierarchy of new types
of responses, meaning the same thing.</p>

<p class='c014'>Gradually these infantile sounds develop inflections and modulations
in pitch, in loudness, in rhythm, and in tone quality. These
inflections are the beginning of beauty in voice, and each new
conquest gives a new form of satisfaction to the child and mother.</p>

<p class='c014'>The mother may stimulate natural forms for expression of
mutual feeling by her own musical laughter. Gradually the playing
with these sounds becomes an object in itself, the making of a
particular sound for mere pleasure. This is the beginning of
singing and the appreciation of musical sounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>We observe the child playing with modulations in pitch, in
loudness, in duration, and in different kinds of tone quality. This
is the beginning of musical experiment, of musical creation, and
musical appreciation in the child. Blessed is the mother who can
appreciate the music thus born. She then sees the significance of
the rhythmic patty-cake as music which gives pleasure to mother
and child alike. She then begins to understand that the jingling
of a bell is sweet music to the child. She can see how the appreciation
of rhythm is gradually revealed through the progressive
development of means of making sounds and hearing varieties of
sound. Perhaps unconsciously she sets patterns for a musical
inflection which the child begins to imitate. To the child, noise is
music, and the discovery of noises and the mastery of various
noises play an immensely rich and important role, even in the
highest forms of adult music.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus, the recognition and feeling of pleasure in sounds, and
the power to make agreeable sounds, reveal to the child an unfolding
musical world. His whole organism responds to it. This
is an element of musical feeling.</p>

<p class='c014'>Let me digress for a moment to say that the beginnings of
mental life tend to develop from two fundamental needs: attraction
and repulsion, likes and dislikes, approaching and getting
away from&mdash;these being respectively the positive and the negative
aspects of adjustment. The smile is the sign of the positive side.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>The companion piece of the smile as a taproot is the frown, which
gradually develops through crying and is the reciprocal of
laughter. The history of the frown and crying is quite parallel to
the history of the smile and laughter in mental evolution and in
the development of the individual.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Music in play.</i> While it does serve a purpose as language in
social adjustment, the musical activity of the young child is expression
for the love of expression itself. This play aspect early differentiates
itself from the use of sounds to convey meaning in language.</p>

<p class='c014'>The child composes, rapidly revealing new melodic progressions,
new rhythms, new kinds of sounds, and new patterns in
the durations of sounds for his own delight in self-expression.
Through them he wins manifestations of appreciation from those
around him who constitute his audience. He repeats each new
achievement as the momentary goal of play until new patterns
progressively take their place. In these actions of musical composition,
the same mental faculties that we see in the active adult
composers are at work, but limited to the child's natural level of
successful achievement.</p>

<p class='c014'>He early reveals command of the four elements of all music,
as such; namely, pitch, loudness, time, and kind of tone or tone
quality; and we observe the unfolding of melody, dynamic expression,
rhythm, and richness of tone. Through these he imitates
the sounds of nature, speech, music, and noises at his level in the
surroundings. In terms of these he develops memories, indulges
in fantasy and creative imagination, and gradually begins to think
about music. These are the avenues through which the child
expresses his needs and urges vocally or instrumentally; but they
are music in so far as they are indulged in for the pleasure of the
hearing or the making of the sounds themselves.</p>

<p class='c014'>Note that the child composes by performing; therefore, each
musical form that he develops is clearly at his command in performance.
Notice also that the repetition of achievement is
limited by the play attitude of always demanding something more
difficult. Composition, performance, appreciation, body response
form interlocking steps. That is what makes the procedure
natural. The joy of conquest, characteristic of play, is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>dominating motive. Here nature has her way in the development of
knowledge, appreciation, and skills.</p>

<p class='c014'>Musical activity is normally a form of play, expression for the
satisfaction in the expression itself without ulterior motive, and
this attitude may be carried through life. A person who cannot
take a play attitude toward music perhaps has no music in him. The
play attitude does not free one from effort, even systematic and
arduous effort, in the acquisition of the art. Witness all the sports
at all stages of growth. There is nothing to relieve us from understanding
facts involved in music; but the driving motive is found
in the play attitude, and the result is pleasure in play. On these
observations of nature's ways in play, the future pedagogy of
music will be built.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Environment.</i> It is astonishing that the child is often treated as
unmusical unless he can sing or play adult compositions or show an
intelligent appreciation of high art forms. How pitiful it is for a
mother to say that her child is not musical because he does not
sing her songs and understand her artistic playing. How vastly
could a mother's appreciation of the child be increased if she
realized what constitutes music at his level and how fundamental
the musical reactions at his level are to the development of music
in the adult!</p>

<p class='c014'>To be musical, the child must be musical in response to his
environment. There are natural laws of evolution in the race and
in the development of the individual for types of reactions to the
music that abounds around us in nature and for the various means
at our command of expression through imitation of them. To the
primitive tribe, the drum is a powerful, thrilling musical instrument.
So are all forms of drumming to the child. He imitates the
whistling, tooting, rattling, banging sounds in his environment,
sometimes until he becomes noisily tiresome. He feels in harmony
with the clock that ticks, the birds that sing, the dog that barks,
the cat that mews. He loves to bang on the piano and blow
his horn.</p>

<p class='c014'>This craving for pleasure in sounds radiates through the
sense of rhythm into graceful movements, the beginnings of dancing
and dramatic action, even from the crudest rhythmic kicking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>and tapping movements of the infant. His speech becomes
rhythmic, melodic, dynamic, beautiful. His whole body becomes
reverberant in response to the sounds of nature. Laughter progressively
acquires new and beautiful forms. Even crying may
give satisfaction of an artistic sort. The swinging of the pendulum
of the old clock on the wall is music. The patter of rain, the
splashing of water have musical elements.</p>

<p class='c014'>The child does not think of the artistic forms as does the
musician; but like the canary which, even if grown in isolation
in a soundproof cage, in due time produces his natural tours in
repertoire, the child instinctively comes out in melody, dynamic
modulation, and rhythm. But all these are modified by the
environment.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Music and speech.</i> Speech has the same media as music;
namely, pitch, loudness, time, and timbre which result in such
musical forms as tonal and dynamic inflection, rhythm, articulation,
and vowel quality. A child is, of course, not conscious of
any of these as such, and yet, under favorable circumstances, will
quickly develop beautiful speech, which means that it is well inflected,
well modulated in loudness, beautifully rhythmic, rich and
clear in vowel qualities. If the child has a good ear, instinctive
liking for these aspects of speech will develop surprisingly early.</p>

<p class='c014'>To give the child musical environment means therefore not
only exposure to formal music but rather a motivation for hearing
musically all sounds around him, for acting rhythmically, and
feeling the rhythmic impulse in all forms of activity, for responding
by imitation or other forms of appreciation to all sounds
beautiful. These acquisitions naturally take the form of beautiful
speech. Musical education in the nursery, therefore, comes most
effectively through informal education toward beautiful speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>The child becomes proficient in speech long before he becomes
correspondingly proficient in musical performance and appreciation.
It is therefore very important to recognize that music and
speech employ the same medium; namely, sounds which vary in
pitch, loudness, duration, and kind. The child reveals flexibility,
richness, rhythm, and all other forms of meaningful inflection in
speech earlier than he does in music. Indeed, by the time the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>child leaves the nursery, even at the age of five, his characteristic
form and command of speech are fairly crystallized. The command
of elements of beautiful speech is the first step in a beautiful
singing voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>Speech is an index to character, and the means for the development
of character. Beautiful speech is musical speech. Genuinely
beautiful speech is a revelation of beautiful character. Let
the mother who worries about early piano or violin lessons first
give thought to formal sympathetic cultivation of a beautiful
speaking voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unfortunately, the child's speech is very largely determined
by imitation of those around him. How few mothers and fathers,
how few teachers, how few older children have beautiful speech!
The young child as a rule, therefore, encounters unfavorable
speech environment. The civilized world is just awakening to the
possibilities and significance of beautiful and effective speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>Train the young child to the appreciation and development of
power in beautiful and effective speech, and you will have laid the
best foundations for musical appreciation and formal entrance
upon musical training.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Musical talent.</i> Children differ in musical talent, both in
degree and in kind. One normal child may be twenty-five, fifty,
or one hundred times as sensitive as another normal child in
matters of time, in matters of pitch, in matters of loudness, and
in matters of tone quality. The normal child may be very high in
one of these four musical traits and low in another. Let me illustrate
how these traits may be observed very early in a very highly
musical child.</p>

<p class='c014'>Playing with a little girl eleven months old, I noticed that she
responded to the music over the radio. I put a simple two-step on
the victrola, and she marked the time correctly by a free sympathetic
swinging of the arms. I changed this to waltz time, and
she picked up the rhythm. As she could not yet stand on her feet,
I held her on all fours, and then she shimmied with her trunk. Was
that child musical? I could give one positive answer. She had a
splendid sense of rhythm and urge for rhythmic action. As I
watched her in succeeding years, she very early developed original
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>dances, and at the age of four gave delight in original "shawl
dances." Her speech very early was beautifully inflected. Her
speech was also very early characterized by fine and meaningful
modulations in loudness for emphasis and meaning. She gave
early evidence of power to imitate different sounds.</p>

<p class='c014'>Of course, the less musical a child is by nature, the more difficult
it is to find early evidences of this sort. We do not need
measuring instruments so much as we need training of teachers
and parents to an understanding of what constitutes musical
capacities so that we can observe the child critically in his early
natural responses. By the age of eight or ten these specific capacities
will become more conspicuous, and at that age the competent
psychologist in music can analyze and measure talents reliably.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Musical education.</i> When and how should musical education
begin? It should begin in the earliest infancy by giving the child
a musical environment suitable to elicit his response. This means
not simply the hearing of formal music, but, far more significantly,
a sympathetic response to the child's natural vocal expressions
at each level, even to the making of sounds of all kinds.</p>

<p class='c014'>The child from the first needs a sympathetic audience. It is
not so much how beautifully the mother sings as how sympathetically
she responds to the beginning croonings of the infant;
and this sympathetic enjoyment includes recognition and encouragement
for the hearing of all sounds around, whether animate
or inanimate. The mother's first task is to be a good listener.</p>

<p class='c014'>The first elements of formal musical training should be devoted
to speech. Ideally this would come most effectively through
the child's opportunity for hearing and imitating the beautiful
sounds and speech of those around him. Even if the mother and
other associates cannot set the model for the child, they can do a
great deal to further musical development by showing their appreciation
of the instinctive outcroppings of the musical qualities of
the child's speech.</p>

<p class='c014'>During the first six years there should be no formal musical
instruction; but, by the end of that period, the musical child
should have gradually acquired a sense of appreciation for musical
sounds, pleasure in self-expression in musical intonations,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>confidence in his ability to compose a tune, some proficiency in singing
and good speech, and some degree of satisfaction in free playing
with an instrument.</p>

<p class='c014'>The principles here developed for early childhood have profound
implications for later musical education. Let the emphasis
lie upon the broadness of the meaning of music to the child, upon
the child's learning by doing, at his natural level of successful
achievement, and upon the utilization of natural motivation in
place of formal instruction.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>Chapter III</i><br />MUSIC BETWEEN THE AGES OF SIX AND TEN</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The question "<i>When</i> should music education begin?" is now
coming to be "<i>How</i> should music education begin?"; because
we now recognize that music should play a large role in the first
five years of child life.</p>

<p class='c014'>Soon after six the child enters school. Here the principles of
educational psychology, now so effectively applied to other primary
and elementary school subjects, have revolutionized the
presentation of music. This has of course been favored by the
recognition of music on the level of the three R's. Music has
come to function in the school not only as something to be
learned but primarily as something to be lived. Primary
teachers are, or will be, trained specifically for this subject.
The old conflict <a id='corr21.13'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='beween'>between</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_21.13'>between</a></span> enthusiasts for rote singing, on the one
hand, and for technical sight reading, on the other, is vanishing.
The approach to music is following new avenues involving
diversified action, creative imagination and thinking in music,
recognition of individual differences, freedom for individual
expression of musical feeling, opportunity for sampling various
avenues of choice in expression, the association of music with
play, dance, and dramatic action, opportunity for hearing music
at the child's level, avoidance of the fostering of a narrow precocity,
and recognition that there is music everywhere&mdash;in speech,
in play, in nature.</p>

<p class='c014'>Parents who now aim to provide private lessons for formal
training in some aspect of music must lay their plans in the light
of all these facts which have come into view so strikingly in the
school. They must understand and evaluate the significance of
this movement in the school, the new status of music, the new role
of private instruction in music, and the availability of a private
teacher who can dovetail with these new facilities and responsibilities.
In the hope of giving some helpful suggestions in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>regard to this planning, I wish to present some psychological
considerations which are, at the present time, reconstructing the
theory and practice of private lessons in music at this age.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>A broadened conception of music.</i> In Chapter II I pointed
out that children coming out of a favorable music situation in
the home, the preschool, the kindergarten, and other school and
playground activities have attained rather astonishing achievement.
Let me repeat, for emphasis:</p>

<p class='c019'>"During the first six years there should be no formal
musical instruction; but by the end of that period, the musical
child should have gradually acquired a sense of appreciation
for musical sounds, pleasure in self-expression in musical intonations,
confidence in his ability to compose a tune, some
proficiency in singing and good speech, and some degree of
satisfaction in free playing with an instrument."</p>

<p class='c014'>This achievement now accomplished in many preschool communities
presents a challenge to the primary teacher and the supervisor
of music in the public schools. And, where pupils come
without such preparation or background, they must begin from
scratch and offer a substitute for it in more concentrated form.</p>

<p class='c014'>Private lessons should be built upon this background and
designed to carry this type of program forward during the next
four years with progressive enrichment of opportunities on the
basis of talent thus revealed and with these types of activity as a
goal in the beginnings of formal training.</p>

<p class='c014'>This point of view turns a large part of the job of the private
music teacher over to the primary school where it is favorably
developed; because only in the group activity and in the avocational
attitude with the avocational atmosphere under technically
qualified teachers can this program of musical education find its
best fruitage for children in general. The private teacher is falling
from her high pedestal of the power to cast the child's musical
mind in the pattern of her own image within a limited musical
skill at this age. On the other hand, the ideal of the school situation
which I have pictured will play happily into her hands by
furnishing a background for a systematic study of voice or a
particular instrument.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>In this procedure, the child's interest may well concentrate
around a single instrument. Furthermore, we are just awakening
to the fact that voice development should begin in this period.
New techniques for the development of a beautiful voice are
coming in, and are adapted to this age. They should play an important
role in this orientation period, and the child's interest may
concentrate around this, as well as around an instrument, especially
through the association of artistic forms of speech with song.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The analysis of talent.</i> Music educators are coming now to a
recognition of the principle that musical education, public and
private, should be given in proportion to the possession of natural
talent and in the direction for which the most favorable indication
is found on the ground of specific talents. Such talents reveal
themselves through the daily activities of the schoolroom, where
the alert teacher understands their significance and directs them
wisely. There are certain basic abilities which are favorable to a
musical life. Some of these can be measured accurately with the
<i>Seashore Measures of Musical Talents</i> in a revised edition now
available through the RCA Victor agencies. They are concerned
with the senses of pitch, loudness, time, timbre, and rhythm,
together with tonal memory. These may be given individually to
children between the ages of six and ten if administered with
good judgment and the child is not required to write the answers.
However, if the teacher is trained in the musical analysis of talent
and the critical observation of children's behavior, inceptive
achievement, and interests in the musical situation, it is possible to
proceed without instruments, since the teacher will know what to
listen for and will be competent to observe with sufficient accuracy
for the purpose in hand. After the fourth grade, "measures of
talents" may be given either as individual or as group tests. They
may furnish a key to the most natural development of musical
type; such as, the tonal, the dynamic, the temporal, or the balanced
types, on the basis of degree of responsiveness to each of
these factors as well as on other specific adaptations for voice or
instrument. The teacher who has such concrete facts in hand will
observe and plan the child's development more critically. Every
private teacher should have a conception of the significance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>individual differences in talent, and might well utilize measurements
of this kind in the studio. The progressive private teacher
should also be able to serve parents in an advisory capacity on
such matters.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not necessary that the teacher should be an expert in
testing; but it is essential that she should understand the nature
of musical talents and have the sort of insight into child life
which has been developed so splendidly in recent scientific studies
of child behavior, especially with reference to the recognition of
natural abilities, the early fostering of these, the devising of
effective motivation, the awarding of praise and blame, and the
setting up of standards of achievement recognizable by the child.
It is, furthermore, reasonable to demand that the teacher herself
should present a good voice in song and speech, have some proficiency
and ingenuity in the manipulation of simple instruments,
and feel deeply the love of music.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Group instruction.</i> The old-fashioned piano lesson was at
fault in various respects. First, time was taken to tell the pupils,
individually, the elements of musical notation; second, the main
function seemed to be to make the pupil "get" his lesson; and
third, the child was expected to acquire a love of music through
the technical approach. These things are now changing. The pupil
now coming from the respectable primary school already has
acquired the elements of sight reading, both from ear to eye and
eye to ear. Any new element in notation can certainly be picked
up incidentally as needed, without waste of time. The position of
the teacher as a taskmaster is also disappearing. True, that eliminates
many a pupil, but probably without much loss to the musical
life of the community. The child comes to the private teacher
already motivated with a feeling and urge for music. Musical
achievement is no longer counted in terms of the number of
lessons taken.</p>

<p class='c014'>The function of the teacher is far more to motivate than to
teach. The thing that counts is how long and faithfully the pupil
works to acquire the proficiency which can only come through
practice. What can be taught in one lesson should suffice for
several times as much practice as is ordinarily expected. Better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>than having the teacher crack the whip for many periods would
be to give the time available for lessons to the pupil for practice
and use more remunerative rewards, even a percentage of the
teacher's fee, to encourage self-help in a larger assignment
through adequate practice.</p>

<p class='c014'>One of the significant advancements in private instruction
for children of this age lies in the direction of class or group
instruction. No effort is made to force all children into the same
cast. Small groups are formed on the pattern of chamber music,
taking children of matched abilities and interests and using music
progressively adapted to their level. Many forms of class instruction
have failed on the ground of the teacher's inability to use
informal procedures in some form of project method. Duets,
trios, quartets, all in the competitive and play mood, can accomplish
great things, even with the youngest children. Few private
teachers have awakened to a realization of the fine possibilities in
that approach. This method is especially adapted to primary instruction
in private music schools in which there are enough pupils
to make competitive promotions from group to group. Most of the
musical information and the motivated drill can be accomplished
through the group. The recognition of this principle may lead to
the development of extracurricular and private organizations under
an inspiring teacher or group of teachers for private instruction.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Formal lessons delayed.</i> The principal point I wish to stress
is that musical education should not begin with formal lessons on
one instrument. Except in the case of rarely-gifted children, such
specialized instruction should come naturally after the general
musical interests have been awakened and the natural abilities
have been revealed. Technical private lessons for children in
general should therefore be begun considerably later than has
been customary. In this there is a threefold saving: First, except
in rare cases, rigid technique of instruction can be responded to
much more economically after the age of eight or ten than before.
A ten-year-old will acquire more than twice as much in a single
lesson as a six-year-old. This will apply even to the much
"touted" necessity for early finger development. Second, during
this period the child should have the freedom to try himself out
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>spontaneously with diversified encouragement in the development
of specific interests; and third, it will take the aspect of drudgery
away from the music lesson. To these may be added the fact that
this liberal procedure helps to give the child a feeling that he is
living music rather than learning it. It involves the play attitude
in the acquisition of an art. The attitude of feeling the necessity
for hard work, which is a very real necessity in music, can best
be cultivated formally after the age of eight or ten.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>A sympathetic listener.</i> Although circumstances may alter
cases, facility in piano playing might well be regarded as a foundation
work in the approach to other instruments. The child's
preference for a particular instrument is generally childish and
will change in the normal course of development. An analysis of
case histories would make an interesting study on this point. The
development of skills in a particular instrument should always be
accompanied by opportunities for sharing the pleasure in this
skill with other children and the presence of a sympathetic
listener in the teacher and the parents. What the child of the
primary-school age needs is more a sympathetic and critical
listener than a task-driver. This type of approach will discredit
the now so prevalent artificial ways of symbolizing music by
attempting to force the teacher's affected and stilted imagery upon
the child's musical mind, which may run naturally in much more
effective channels. It is a notable fact that the great musicians
who emerged as very precocious made their early and distinctive
progress far more through freedom for self-expression than
through instruction from the masters.</p>

<p class='c014'>In brief, the private lesson to the child should pattern, at the
child's age level, after the procedure followed in adult instruction
in music at its best; namely, that of sympathetic and inspiring
criticism and guidance rather than the dealing out of predigested
pellets of interpretation and technique. The general attitude to be
cultivated in the child should therefore be freedom for self-expression
rather than mere willingness to absorb set tasks. In
this attitude the problem of scales, exercises, and calisthenic
techniques will come in the natural course of events without
being forced.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span><i>Music lovers vs. virtuosi.</i> One of the first essential steps in
training at this level is to educate the mother to the notion that
only in very rare cases will the child become a virtuoso or a professional
musician, and that she has no right to pose as an exhibitioner.
The normal child is richly endowed with powers for
diversified development. By too early emphasis upon a "gift" it
is possible to produce monstrosities and pathological temperament.
True, a gifted child beginning, for example, by taking lessons at
five and being effectively motivated, may produce extraordinary
results before ten, but generally at the expense of a normal
development of the child as a person. An ill-guided enthusiast
can make of the bright normal child a mathematical freak or a
contortionist before the age of ten; but who wants that for the
welfare of the child? It is a form of human sacrifice. The time
for intensive specialization should normally come after the age of
ten. Parents and teachers should shun the development of precocity
as they shun disease. Indeed, in ninety cases out of a
hundred, excessive precocity is a form of disease, a distortion of
the normal personality.</p>

<p class='c014'>The goal in musical education in this period should be to
recognize individual differences, natural capacities, and native
interests and urges in their natural stages for the development of
a well-rounded personality. We have long since abandoned the
notion that every girl should play the piano. What we need to
learn now is that we should not allow the musically-gifted child
to die with all the music in him, and that the musically gifted
should not be exploited. The middle ground is that all children
who have musical ability should learn to love music and live it
naturally, each according to his ability.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>Chapter IV</i><br />MUSIC AND YOUTH</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>There is a distinctively musical period in life: the period of
youth. Youth is the age of emotional response and of social
awakening, the age of serious play, the age of decision and elimination,
the dominant learning period, and the age of freedom and
leisure. Before this period the life of the child has been relatively
tranquil. After this period the occupational affairs of life are more
exacting. Before this period most children participate in music in
a routine way without professing it. After this period large
numbers of those who have had training or have expressed their
enthusiasms in rich participation in the musical life cool off, as it
were, and continue their musical activities in a more or less perfunctory
way, except for the few who have taken up the art
professionally or continue as enthusiastic amateurs.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>YOUTH, THE AGE OF MUSIC</h3>

<p class='c016'><i>The emotional age.</i> For the present purpose we may think of
youth as represented by the age of the teens, usually beginning in
the high school. It is a brief period of storm and stress, emotional
awakening and emotional struggles, in which the various emotional
drives, more or less latent before, assert themselves, often
to cool off or to be attenuated in later life. The older psychologists
spoke of it as a period of rebirth, the passing from the period of
protected and directed life into the emergence of a self-asserting
personality. At the time of this awakening, life is largely emotional;
it is the period of ardent love, of social awakening, of
sports and play of all kinds, of fortes and faults, of artistic efforts,
of devotion to ideals, of awakening and emergence of controlled
imagination, of the development of the great enthusiasms for
life. Poetry, conversation, dancing, heroic stunts, emotional adventures
of all kinds have their fling. This emotional tendency finds
its expression in the language of emotion, of which music is one.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span><i>The age of serious play.</i> Youth is the age of serious play.
Before this period the child has spontaneously played much and
hard enough, but now youth enters into specialized sports, finds a
play outlet in one or more of the arts, and with the play attitude
takes up serious roles in social responsibilities. All these are comparatively
new and are, therefore, entered on with fresh enthusiasm.
Emotion has a way of burning itself up. Toward the end
of the college course, youth, having had its fling, feels fed up on
sports and after that may not even sit on the bleachers or the side
lines. The same is true of many of the artistic outlets. When
youth comes of age, the ventures into poetry, music, dramatics,
and various other forms of art cool off for the majority.
This loss of interest is especially noticeable in the social activities,
in which the vocal arts, the dance, and other instruments of wooing
play so large a role. It should, however, be said that the
better our education, home life, and vocational activities are
organized for right living, the less is the break at the beginning
of this period of youth, as well as at the end.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The age of decision and eliminations.</i> The persons exceptionally
gifted in music are precocious in that their artistic awakening
comes earlier, and yet the real assertion and the serious functioning
of their musical inspirations appear most characteristically
and pass through their crucial period in the teens, after which
large numbers of those who have gone through the fire of struggle
for survival and mastery pass out of the picture.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The educational age.</i> Youth is the dominant educational period.
Those who in this period qualify for higher education can and
should continue their studies with organized effort and with confidence
in success; but, on account of the American popular
demand for higher and higher education, many of those who
should be eliminated during this period float on, ill-motivated,
ill-directed, floundering through college or professional education
without regard to the worth-whileness of the procedure. Unfortunately
American education has not made adequate provision for
the diversifying of training, especially in the practical outlets
at this age.</p>

<p class='c014'>This educational dominance of the period of the teens is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>particularly true for music. Unfortunately, large numbers of youth
naturally endowed with the power of enjoying music have not
even been discovered up to this time, either by themselves or by
others, and they may pass through this last stage of opportunity
without being discovered and often without realizing what they
are missing. At this age the prospective musician will begin to try
himself out, will discover the necessity for untiring and well-directed
work, will concentrate in the field of his most natural
musical outlet, and will work hard in the face of the imminence
of the decision as to success or failure in his own judgment, in
the judgment of his teachers, and in the judgment of his companions
and public. If successful here, he may continue his
musical education in specialization, since music is essentially a
body of skills. At the same time he may show a due regard for the
necessity of a broadening education under larger horizons. Fortunate
are they who follow these sound procedures.</p>

<p class='c014'>However, many students overlook the fact that, if their music
is to be an avocation, it is to be pursued merely for the pleasure
inherent in it. They may struggle along simply because they have
had initial training in this field, but without adequate motivation
or anticipation of significant results. Achievement in music is an
artistic performance, and we should not add recklessly to the
large group in society who feel that their early efforts were wasted
and who have to go through life apologizing for their failure or
mediocrity in the artistic sense. At the same time we must bear in
mind that satisfaction in musical performance for the great
majority of persons comes from the pursuit of the cruder forms
of music, especially singing. Group singing, ordinary piano accompaniment
for singing, dance music, and ragtime of all sorts
should not be discouraged in so far as they form a natural outlet
for those who pursue them. After all, "high-brow" music plays a
very small vital role even in high society.</p>

<p class='c014'>Unfortunately, as in academic subjects, the real elimination
of the unfit is not accomplished effectively, and there are masses
of music students dribbling along with at best a low mediocrity
as the destination in sight. Since music, to be of service in later
life, must be either professional or eminently satisfying as an
<span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>avocation after advanced work in the subject, the necessity of
making discriminating and wise eliminations before a youth is of
age cannot be stressed too strongly. A wise selection and guidance
at this stage should, however, in no way discourage those who get
a genuine satisfaction out of music and are wisely motivated,
especially for the keeping of an avocational interest alive with a
modest degree of attainment.</p>

<p class='c014'>We must face the fact that most of those who are highly
gifted in music and are deeply devoted to it will not enter the profession
of music and may be engaged in such exacting occupations
as to limit the time that they can devote, avocationally, to their
favorite art. Yet of all the lovers of music, these are perhaps the
ones who get the greatest enjoyment out of music and contribute
most happily to the musical life of the community.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is not sufficient to get children started in musical education.
They must also be motivated and given the outlets for self-expression
which tend to have lasting value in their lives. A drab picture
is drawn by comparing the number of those who, through high
school, have had the privilege of good training with the number
of those in the best social groups of our cities today who actually
contribute, and take pleasure in contributing, to the musical life
of the community and to their own personal moments of leisure.
Here is a challenge to adult education: a challenge to find and
encourage self-expression in music in adult life. Nevertheless, a
strong argument can be made for musical education even if it
functions only during the period of adolescence.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The age of leisure.</i> Youth is, in a sense, the age of leisure. We
think of a gentleman of leisure as a person who, by virtue of his
being a gentleman, is active in pursuits which are not necessary
for the earning of his bread and butter. If he is not active, he is
not a gentleman. If his activity does not add to a genuine enrichment
of his own life and the life of the community, he is not a
gentleman. If he does not know how to play, he is not a gentleman.
The same ideas apply in principle to the concept of a lady of
leisure. The adolescent youth has many of the characteristics and
the opportunities of a gentleman of leisure. These opportunities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>do not mean an easy life, but a life characterized especially by
the freedom to do just the things that he likes to do. These opportunities
include, for many happily adjusted personalities, the
development of the art of loafing: the substitution for mere
sitting, for mere gossiping, for mere eating and drinking, and
for degrading pastimes, an active life of restful, satisfying,
wholesome self-expression in the play attitude.</p>

<p class='c014'>The high-school or beginning college student is not, as a rule,
working for a livelihood, is not held down to the specific demands
of a trade, a business, or a profession. He is in a period of preliminary
skirmishes, and the public school programs provide
liberally for these. He may spend his leisure time in the strenuous
work of athletics or of any intellectual, artistic, or social pursuit
lying outside the demands of the curriculum; he has time for
such excursions.</p>

<p class='c014'>One of the happiest ways of spending his leisure time may be
in the enthusiastic pursuit of musical activities. When he gets
into college, these opportunities are more restricted; when he gets
into his job, they are still more limited. Whatever the line of
pursuit, these extracurricular activities are indulged in as a form
of play. Nobody, however, can express in play all his intellectual,
artistic, and social dreams or urges. Therefore the gentleman of
leisure in the high school is forced to make a selection, and, in
doing so, he rightly follows his natural bent of mind. If he casts
his lot with music, he will train hard, and have the social satisfaction
of supporting his musical group. Music becomes a game,
involving contests with defeats and victories. It becomes a topic
for conversation in social leisure. While the high-school program
and the junior-college program do not emphasize rigorous technical
training as a part of the academic curriculum, the majority
of students get their musical satisfaction from the way in which
they utilize their leisure for music. It is significant that at this
age the stress is not on the hearing of music but rather on participation
in musical performance. This period is the age of action,
perhaps the best type of preparation for the listening stage since it
follows the educational principle of learning by doing.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>MUSIC FOR YOUTH</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>During the present century most extraordinary progress has
been made in the provision of musical facilities for youth by the
recognition of music as an academic subject, by the early and
vital training in the grades, by the development of group activities
in voice and instrument as a dominant extracurricular activity,
by the motivation of training through opportunities for public
performance and contest, and by the popularization of music
through phonograph and radio.</p>

<p class='c014'>Up to the end of the past century youth had had no significant
opportunities for music in the scheme of things. Music had to
come through the taking of private lessons, often a drudgery
without regard to likes or dislikes. The approach was purely technical.
The mastery of the scales, though technically significant, was
not inspiring to the emergent musical mind and did not reveal the
vast vistas of opportunity for self-expression in music. Music
lessons were limited to those who could afford to pay for them.
Few people had heard any good music. It had no significant
status in the program of public education. Youth had no chance.
<i>Music for youth has been discovered in the past forty years.</i></p>

<p class='c014'><i>Music, an academic subject.</i> When music gained recognition
on a par with the three R's in primary and elementary education,
America entered on a new era. National music organizations of
teachers developed. These began with the slogan, "Music for
every child at public expense." Realizing the futility of making
every child musical, they modified this slogan to, "Music at
public expense for every child in proportion to his natural ability."
The market was flooded with educational music books and systems.
Time for musical training was set aside in the regular curriculum
of the schools. It was recognized that only a person who
has musical ability and training can teach music effectively.
Scientific principles from other subjects were adopted. Specialized
training for musical supervisors was provided in teachers' colleges.
Teaching was improved. Groups of children were segregated
into vocal and instrumental organizations, both for
curricular and extracurricular activities. Instruments were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>furnished at public expense. Credit for music gained current coinage
on a par with history and chemistry. The introduction of principles
of educational psychology led to selective admission and
elimination and gave the teachers a basis for the administration of
praise or blame in achievement. Few public school subjects can
point to a similar epoch-making stride. These achievements today
give youth a chance in music.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Orientation in the grades.</i> For the musical life of youth at and
soon after the high-school age, the training in the grades was most
significant, and that, in turn, was rooted in a national awakening
to the possibilities and the responsibilities of music in the earliest
years in the home and the kindergarten. This awakening was
strengthened by the recognition given art in general. Music early
became associated with the speech arts, the dance, and other games.
The development in the graphic and the plastic arts, though slow,
was somewhat parallel with music for these early years. In the
eight years in the grades there developed a process of selective opportunities
for the pursuit of music so that freshmen entered the
high school as a group fairly differentiated on the basis of abilities,
opportunities, likes and dislikes, and ambitions for music.</p>

<p class='c014'>This differentiation had a twofold effect on the high school:
First, the elimination of pupils who, on various legitimate
grounds, did not qualify for musical training at public expense at
this stage and, second, the beginning of specialization for those
who had previously found themselves or who at this stage made
a happy decision. Thus the development of music in the high
school has followed logically on the early development of music
in the grades, and in like manner the development of music at the
college level is now beginning to follow the development of music
in the high school.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Group activities in voice and instrument.</i> Youth is the age of
learning by doing. This principle has been implemented in high-school
education by the development of group activities, both in
theoretical and in practical music, both in the curricular and in the
extracurricular activities. Throughout, the emphasis has been on
action. Instruments are supplied at public expense; opportunities
are given for participation in programs of entertainment; and a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>stimulus has been climaxed by the introduction of local, state, and
national contests for groups and for individuals.</p>

<p class='c014'>The adoption of the principle of group instruction at this
level has had many significant advantages. It draws large numbers
of pupils into group activities for the social value of the activity
in itself and for the social value of participation in public life. It
has lessened the cost of musical education many times over by
training ten or a hundred pupils in a group as effectively, in many
respects, as they could be trained by individual instruction. Group
instruction has, perhaps, been the strongest leverage for the
motivation of musical pursuits in the school. It has increased the
pursuit of individual instruction on the basis of discovered needs,
for example, in the mastery of a particular instrument for participation
in the band or orchestra or in the development of a
voice discovered in the group. The individual instruction has thus
been motivated and made to fit into particular niches in the musical
groups or in the choice of vocational pursuits in society.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Contests.</i> The development of contests both in individual and
in group performance has had a profound effect on the development
of music in youth and is destined to serve in large part as a
clearinghouse. Educators recognize many drawbacks in the plan
of contests. Preparation for the contests requires excessive time
and highly trained teachers. A contest becomes an occasion for
the revelation and the objectifying of differences in individuals
and groups. It involves some little expense. It tends to discourage
the pupils who cannot qualify.</p>

<p class='c014'>But let us look at the other side. In the state of Iowa, for
example, the state-wide contests, which have been conducted for
about the past ten years, have done far more than anything else
to vitalize music education in the high school. Four years ago I
became acquainted with a group of ten girls who came from a
little town three hundred miles away. They had not placed in the
contest; they had had no chance. I supposed that this contest
would be the last that we should see of them, but the next year
they appeared in a body&mdash;happy and optimistic, in a fighting
mood&mdash;and won honors. I asked how they accounted for their
success, and they said, "When we got home and reported that we
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>had had no chance in the state contest, the commercial club of our
town raised a purse and employed a teacher to come into the high
school and train us in music." When the commercial club goes
into its pockets in the interest of putting music on the map in its
community, music is beginning to function in that community.</p>

<p class='c014'>Nobody cares to tune a fiddle for four years; but, if he has the
opportunity to play a tune, he will gladly keep the fiddle tuned.
This fact has been shown on a large scale as a result of the contest
plans. Not only have the final local, district, and state contests
become goals, but every daily practice has gained an objective
and is a topic for social conversation. The contests have made
each participant critical of his own performance and the performance
of the group and have also made each ambitious for improvement.
They have raised standards of selection in musical
material. They have resulted in the giving of higher musical
education to large numbers of gifted persons whose talents would
not otherwise have come to the serious attention of parents or
educational interests. The methods of judging these contests
have been greatly improved in the direction of offering encouragement
where encouragement is due without discouraging more
modest attainments where they are indicated.</p>

<p class='c014'>Educators used to think that football was the only thing that
would arouse enthusiastic support in the field of avocational
activities for youth; but, as I have witnessed the attitude of
high-school pupils in training for musical contests, heard reports
of the attitudes of the parents and the backers, and watched the
culmination of enthusiasm at the annual contest, I can say that
there can be, for youth, as substantial enthusiasm in contests of
music as there is in football. In other words, the youth of the
state have entered into music in the spirit of play, with determination
to train well, play hard, and win if possible. Enthusiasms
for a center of interest in public and in private have been
found in this music.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The hearing of music.</i> Within the past forty years, also,
America has for the first time begun to hear music, good, bad, and
indifferent. When the first phonograph came to our city, the host
at an evening reception furnished music in a mysterious way. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>had installed the phonograph in a niche curtained off in the hallway
so that the direction from which the sound emerged was
difficult to detect. He played three or four songs by a male quartet,
which were richly applauded by his audience on the supposition
that he had stationed a male quartet somewhere in the
house. Music had come into the social group in a mysterious way.</p>

<p class='c014'>Throughout the foregoing discussion I have stressed musical
performance because action is the way of youth, the way of education,
and the way of any preparation for the listening mood and
critical attitude. The development of the opportunities for listening
has, of course, been <a id='corr38.11'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='unparalled'>unparalleled</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_38.11'>unparalleled</a></span> in the history of the world.
The masses are given the opportunity of hearing good music.
Many have taken the attitude of sneering at the music offered by
phonograph and radio on the grounds of quality of rendition
and of choice of type; but it is safe to say that what is offered
is what people want, and there is some basis for saying that to a
great extent what people really want is what is good for them.
On the other hand, the furnishing of music at all levels has unquestionably
had the marked effect of raising the American level
of musical appreciation step by step. People can be educated to
listen, and in a marvelous way the radio has really taught people
to listen. You cannot learn to swim without going near the water.
Radio has had the effect of discouraging some persons from the
development of musical skills in performance, because they realize
that what they can hear is so superior to anything that they can
do. On the other hand, radio has stirred the musical interests of
the masses into appreciation of the possibilities of music at their
respective levels and not only has made them whistle the tunes but
has encouraged them to participate in various modes of performance.
Listening to the "canned" music has certainly gone far to
develop the ability for listening to legitimate music on the stage.</p>

<p class='c014'>Some years ago I had the privilege of being the guest of the
city of Copenhagen for a week. Among the entertainments offered
by the city was a grand opera. The invitation came in the form
of a large, beautifully engraved card of marked distinction and
good taste. Attached to it was the actual ticket to one of the best
seats in the house, and the price printed on this ticket was, in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>American money, twenty-three cents. It can be said almost
literally that, when grand opera is played in Copenhagen, people
of all classes come out and tend to listen with appreciation and
more or less discrimination. The people have been educated to
hear music. It has been brought down to their level. Therefore
music functions in the social and home life of that city. Music
of a very high order furnishes the entertainment in the parks and
the public halls. That tradition is fast coming to this country, and
the effective training of our youth will do much to hasten the day.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>Chapter V</i><br />THE MUSICAL TEMPERAMENT</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>What makes a musician temperamental? Tell a musician he
is temperamental, and he will take offense. Yet perhaps
the thing in his personality of which he is most proud is the
possession of a musical temperament. This characteristic inconsistency
has a basis in psychological fact; namely, that the exhibition
of artistic temperament frequently leads to attitudes and
actions which the rest of the world may criticize and view with
amusement; but, on the other hand, the finest expressions of
musicianship would perhaps be impossible without the possession
of an artistic temperament.</p>

<p class='c014'>Many persons who pass as musicians are neither temperamental
nor musical. A great many of those who ply the art of
music do not have musical minds in any basic sense. Their art
consists in certain skills often built into a purely matter-of-fact
organism. I therefore see no reason why such people in the
musical world who do not show any artistic temperament have
any reason to boast of the fact.</p>

<p class='c014'>The highly temperamental musician is a species of genius in
some degree. As such, he has been described by musicians, scientists,
and psychiatrists in a very copious body of literature on the
subject, especially that dating since the time of Lombroso, who
regarded all geniuses as degenerates. The modern psychiatrist has
frequently presented a picturesque view of the temperamental
person in terms of the rising science and art of psychiatry, which
is supposed to explain all deviations from normal behavior in
terms of psychopathology. The old saying was that we are all
more or less sane; the psychiatrist today says we are all more or
less psychopathic. The current literature on mental hygiene is
characterized by this point of view. Another point of view has
proved fascinating since the coming in of Freud, in that deviations
of this sort are accounted for in terms of suppressions,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>defense reactions, and other manifestations of the libido. Much
light is thrown on the problem by the great musician's exaltation
of the artistic mind in action, thus revealing essential temperamental
traits on the basis of first-hand experience and artistic
theory. A temperamental musician is the most merciless portrayer
of his own species. Since the temperamental person is always
an interesting person, all of these accounts are lively and each
revealing from its own point of view, giving us much genuine
insight into the nature of the temperamental person in all fields.</p>

<p class='c014'>Descriptions of the musical temperament are, as a rule, vivacious
and luminous, thrillingly interesting. If a competent analyst
would follow Stokowski for one day during the season and picture
in high lights, full of concrete examples, the experience and behavior
of this great conductor from the whirl of emotional enthusiasms
and conflicts into which he awakens in the morning to the
convivial abandon during refreshments after the evening performance,
we should have a spicy and animated picture of the
musical temperament. If written by the smart commentator in
the columns of <i>Esquire</i>, it might even be racy. Such pictures
have often been drawn in fragments. A similar picture might be
made exclusively by direct quotation from biographies, autobiographies,
and letters of great musicians, such as Beethoven
and Wagner, whose lives are now on record. The temperamental
musician is not competent to analyze himself because he does not
see himself as others see him. Literary chats about musicians are
full of quirks and eccentricities giving realistic examples of a
temperamental life. These might be organized into a fairly complete
characterization of a distinctive musical temperament.</p>

<p class='c014'>All such exhibits would be of the emotional type, dramatic
extravaganzas, interesting and significant, and there are many
such extant. The inceptive science of the psychology of music
takes a different point of view, aiming to account for the highly
temperamental person partly in terms of heredity and partly in
terms of inherent elements in the situation in which he lives and
performs. The music psychologist must content himself to deal in
a cold analytical way with verifiable and orderly facts in order to
contribute something toward a scientific foundation for a systematic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>and functional psychology of the musical mind. In attempting
this approach, I realize how tame and stilted such an effort must
seem to the fiery musical temperament; and even at its best the
psychologist will regard the account as speculative, because it is
seldom based upon experiment. I have delved into musical biography
and autobiography of great musicians with an eye toward the
discovery of their outstanding mental characteristics from a psychological
point of view. On this basis I must make a bold venture
by attempting to trace the elements in a musical situation
which lead to the development of temperamental behavior and
thus contribute toward the answer to the question, "What makes
a musician temperamental?"</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Physiological irritability.</i> The highly-gifted musician responds
physiologically to sound stimuli to a very high degree because he
has inherited a genetic constitution which is anatomically and
physiologically exceptionally responsive to sound. In other words,
quite apart from consciousness of sound or thought of music, his
physical organism responds to acoustic stimuli of all kinds which
keep nerve and muscle in a state of tension. This tends to create a
state of unrest and irritability. Without leading to actual hearing,
it may arouse associations of a sort of dreamlike or dramatic
nature which may play a very large role in the conscious life. It
may create a state of well-being and happy associations, but perhaps
more frequently irritation and noxious day-dreaming associations
and emotional eruptions. The sounds may come from a
squeaking chair, the sizzling of a kettle, the song of a bird, the
cry of an infant. Most frequently sounds affecting the organism
in this way are inconspicuous and commonplace in the environment;
but they may often be strong; such as, the rattling of a
train or the chattering in a crowd, of which the musician does not
become conscious, although physiologically irritated.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Tonal sensitivity.</i> All great musicians are highly sensitive to
sound in all its elements. A physiological irritability acoustically
leads to a profuse awareness of sounds. This sensitive and selective
hearing gives the musician a richness of material in the
musical medium. He becomes intolerant and rebellious to disturbing
sound stimuli which have no such effect upon unmusical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>persons. To him, the world of sounds has infinite richness of resources
for musical pleasure, but equally exceptional resources
for the suffering of musical pain.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Artistic license.</i> To the trained musical individual sounds are
heard as different from what a matter-of-fact listener hears. The
hearing of pitch, loudness, time, and timbre is not in the ratio of
1:1 with the physical sound, but always runs into artistic analysis
and interpretation with artistic license. The musical interval, the
dynamic phrasing, the rhythm, and the tone quality are always
heard in relation to their artistic setting. Here we find auditory
illusions operating in their fullest glory. The pitch value varies
with the quality of the sound. Time may be a substitute for stress
and vice versa. A subjective rhythm is richer and far more realistic
than the physical rhythm. The quality of tone is heard in
relation to its musical meaning. To the musician, the hearing is
not so much a question of true pitch, formal accent, temporal
rhythm, or vowel quality as it is a matter of musical balance and
a recognition of artistic deviation from the true. Meticulously
exact performance of a Bach score would be musically intolerable.
Notes are frail symbols. The performer must interpret
even the shortest measure rhythm or single note value. Thus,
while fine sensory discrimination in all the aspects of sound is
essential for correct hearing and tone production, the more essential
thing is his ability to play with artistic power and impulse in
hearing and producing artistic balance and artistic deviation from
the rigid. In this artistic balance and deviation, he may be guided
by certain artistic rules, but his direct emotional interpretation is
far more significant. In this lies individuality. He is constantly
tempted to be extravagant.</p>

<p class='c014'>Thus, in all the variants, combinations, and modulations of
pitch, loudness, time, and timbre, the musician hears, feels, and
gives meaning to fine and subtle distinctions, many of them quite
divergent from the physical tones. At this level, temperament
shows itself in exceedingly fine responsiveness to tones which
may be a matter of utter indifference or impossibility to the
unmusical. This capacity is largely inborn, both in the way of sensitivity
to sound and a general nervous, if not neurotic, disposition,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>and is in itself enough to make the musician different from
other people. Artistic license as a medium for self-expression is,
therefore, clear evidence of a musical temperament.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Ear-mindedness.</i> The successful musician is ear-minded as
distinguished from the painter who is fundamentally eye-minded.
This ear-mindedness grows out of his genetic auditory constitution
at birth and develops through the practical use that he makes
of the various attributes of sounds. Fundamentally, it is the
tonal image which, in the great musicians, is practically as vivid,
stable, and complete as the ordinary perception of the actual
physical sound. His memories, his imagination, his creative work
practically all operate in terms of his powerful auditory image,
usually supplemented by strong motor and visual imagery. This
makes him different from the businessman, the objective scientist,
and the man on the street. The fact that he can live subjectively
in this tonal world gives him a type of isolation in which he feels
the superiority of his power and becomes disposed to assert his
rights, privileges, and dominance in a domain in large part
separated from ordinary affairs. Thus, the powerful imagery
becomes one of his richest and most fundamental resources for
exclusiveness as a musician and, when cultivated in the field of
artistry, tends to set him apart from the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Affective response.</i> Since the business of the musician is to
hear and produce beautiful effects in sound, he differs from the
ordinary listener in that sounds of all kinds not only have intellectual
orientation value but are habitually responded to in terms
of beauty or ugliness, pleasure or pain. They give him warmth or
chills, both of which create feelings of unrest. Instead of identifying
a sound as the rumbling of a train, he identifies it as ugly&mdash;something
which disturbs and irritates him. Instead of identifying
the sound as the song of a bird, he responds vigorously
in terms of likes and dislikes.</p>

<p class='c014'>Emotional pursuits are usually sexually stimulating, and persistent
emotionality is likely to manifest itself in love "scenes",
good or bad. As a mate, the temperamental musician may be a
most ardent and exquisite lover or a most irritable person to
live with. This is aggravated by the fact that the artistic behavior
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>is worshipped by the opposite sex, often to an annoying degree.
Hence, love, self-defense in love, and a sense of superiority in
love are keynotes to the temperamental musician's life.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The esthetic mood.</i> The musician is in search of the beautiful
and therefore, conversely, responds unfavorably to the ugly. His
professional life is, in the main, emotional as distinguished from
the intellectual life of the scholar in other fields or the action-patterns
of men of affairs. Whether he is a virtuoso, a creator of
music, or a director, he is working on emotions through emotions,
trying to re-create for the listener the feelings with which he
himself is imbued. He lives so intensely and habitually in this
activity that he becomes recognized as highly and persistently
emotional. This extreme emotionality in his daily work sets him
off against the matter-of-fact mind. We say of the intensely
artistic person in action that he burns himself up. The emotional
life is expensive and flitting; it flashes and explodes and is in
danger of running out of control.</p>

<p class='c014'>This emotionality tends to transfer not only to other forms of
art but to ordinary things and situations; such as, money, raiment,
or social amenities. Sometimes this takes the form of the characteristic
bohemian. He may spend his wages on payday and
starve the rest of the month in utter complacence. All his life
tends to be set at high tension. He lives dominantly in a mood
and therefore often becomes objectionally moody through his
impulsive behavior.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Exhibitionism.</i> There is an accretion to the musical temperament
in a sort of hierarchy of defense reactions which may be
characterized as exhibitionism. The musical mind is pulling on
one end of a leash, as it were, trying to drag the more or less
resistant and incapable into his own beautiful emotional life, and
he feels the drag. Therefore, he becomes impatient and uses ways
and means of exclusiveness in withdrawal from the world, or he
takes the opposite attack&mdash;display. To him, countless means of
personal display justify their end, the glorifying of his noble
art. Therefore, we see the musical temperament in this artistic
form in the manner of living, eating, dressing, and sleeping, and in
the demand for hero worship. We see this in the extreme form in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>the conductor who feels that he must have his choir, his orchestra,
his band members each individually at his command. He is like a
general in action. For this purpose, he must pose as a great
authority, as a hero standing for something superior in the way
of personal interpretation, as a critical judge of the beautiful, as
having undisputed power, feeling the necessity of imposing his
own emotional individuality on a comparatively cool and often
resistant group. This is true on a smaller scale in all musical
leadership, composition, performance of the virtuoso, musical
criticism and passionate listening.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Symbolism.</i> The main function of the great musician is to
make his music symbolic. He must take the listener out of the
humdrum attitudes of life through the avenue of musical feeling
into a state of abandon, which, in its extreme form, approaches
ecstasy and obliviousness to material surroundings and facts.
Even the devices of program music give but remote and stilted
aid. His function is to enable the listener to live the art as he
himself lives it symbolically. In this respect he differs from the
sculptor and the painter who, while cultivating this symbolic
attitude, are clearly held to the necessity of utilizing objective
realities. It is not easy for the musician to take himself out of
this mood. At the moment that he talks shop and business, the
symbolizing habit is constantly pressing in upon him. Through his
mastery of the symbolic life he feels rich, exclusive, powerful,
and self-contained. Some people think that is queer.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Precocity.</i> Since, as a rule, the musically gifted are proportionately
precocious, they begin early in childhood to realize their
peculiar gift for musical appreciation, individual interpretation,
and often fabulous child performance as more or less child
prodigies. This tendency to become a prodigy is inherent in musical
precocity and starting early makes him conspicuous as a
child, interferes with his adaptation to the behavior of the common
man, and leads to a specialization and intensification of
those elements which gain for him the approbation of his constituency,
a following for the hero, and towering admiration.
On the other hand, it makes him an object of ridicule.</p>

<p class='c014'>Usually it is the narrowly-educated musician that is strikingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>temperamental. To excel in his art, supreme effort has often
centered upon that goal at the sacrifice of a broadening education
and the development of a well-rounded and healthy-minded personality.
Current academic recognition of music and improved
facilities for training will decrease the number of temperamental
musicians. After all, temperament is not all a gift: it is largely
acquired through learning in the school of hard knocks. It is
often a cheap imitation.</p>

<p class='c014'>What then is the musical temperament? It is a species of the
artistic behavior found in all artistic pursuits, arising partly from
heredity and partly from training, environment, and simulation;
intensified by high sensitivity, highly-strung disposition, dominant
ear-mindedness, emotional strain, lopsided education, pursuit
of esthetic goals, leadership and hero worship, and often a
forced precocity.</p>

<p class='c014'>This type of analysis could be carried much farther, but
these items may suffice as fair samples to show that the artistic
temperament in music is an essential gift demanded by the nature
of the art. It may be good or bad, inborn or cultivated, genuine
or simulated, and often runs into eccentricities so that we frequently
view it in a superior attitude of amusement. But let us
thank all the gods in the Kingdom of the Muses for their great
gift, the potentially good musical temperament.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>Chapter VI</i><br />MUSICAL INHERITANCE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>The whole problem of mental inheritance is in the air, both in
the sense that it is current and in the sense that it is relatively
intangible. The struggle is best illustrated in the current approaches
to the problem of inheritance of intelligence. In this the
geneticist has not got far from base, but much has been learned
in regard to the nature of the issues involved. In the field of music
the geneticist has approached the subject experimentally without
understanding the musical life; and the musician has approached
the matter practically without being a competent experimenter.
The psychologist has certainly not done his duty in clarifying the
issues. The most pressing need at the present time is for such
clarification. This can not be the work of one man or one generation,
but must be achieved through co-operation of both sides in
order to clear the way for valid experimentation.</p>

<p class='c014'>In order to indicate the character of the problem we are now
facing, I shall first venture to state some fundamental assumptions
upon which probably all competent investigators agree and,
second, venture a little way in the direction of identifying concepts
of musical life which can be dealt with experimentally.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>ESSENTIAL PREMISES</h3>

<p class='c016'>The mechanism of heredity lies in a single germ cell carrying
the character-determining chromosomes which consist of organized
chains of genes. In the character and organization of these
genes in the fertilized cell we find the complete "blueprint" for
the future individual in so far as it is to be determined by heredity.
In the twenty-four pairs of chromosomes in the fertilized human
germ cell we find the long and diversified heritage of each parent
represented through the union of the sperm and the ovum. The
selection and the organization of the genes in these chromosomes
adequately represent what the future individual can be.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>This genetic constitution is modified by the cytoplasm, the
supporting part of the cell which is its first environment, and
further by the entire embryonic environment. Any changes that
take place after the launching of this cell, whether before or after
birth, are regarded as environmental. In the embryonic life, this
germinating cell develops by processes of cell division and specialization
into the complete human organism ready to function more
or less immediately after birth. This heritage has fabulous resources
in the form of possible facilities for future development.
As nature was prolific in the storing and transmission of countless
hereditary characters in the genetic constitution, so the equipment
of the child at birth is astonishingly prolific in the provision
it makes for diversified development of the individual. Development
from this stage on must, therefore, of necessity take place
through a process of selection and specialization in which certain
characters are given right of way and many are subordinated or
inhibited by conflicting interests, but the great mass remain
relatively latent or dormant. We may assume that superior musical
talent is determined in large part by superior musical heredity,
and that inferior musical talent or lack of talent may be determined
in large part by a correspondingly defective heredity.</p>

<p class='c014'>The science of heredity in the strictest sense focuses upon the
study of the identification and organization of the genes in relation
to the determination of characters which shall appear in the
genetic constitution and determine future structures and functions
of the individual. When the geneticist deals with specific
anatomical structures, this relationship is traceable with comparative
ease; but when he comes to deal with more or less complicated
physiological or mental functions, the tracing of this relationship
becomes rather baffling on account of the complexity of
the final product.</p>

<p class='c014'>Turning then to the issues involved in the interpretation of
musical inheritance, we must face certain theoretical assumptions.
One of them is that a scientific study of musical heredity cannot
be pursued on the assumption that mind and body are two distinct
entities, each inherited independently. Nor can we hold the
old doctrine of psychophysical parallelism. All human genetics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>proceeds on the assumption that the human individual is one
psychophysical organism. Our musical experience, observation
and measurement will therefore represent views from the mental
side; our organic studies may be views of the same things from
the physical side.</p>

<p class='c014'>Furthermore, musicality is not one specific human trait but
an infinite hierarchy of traits running through the entire gamut
of the psychophysical musical organism. To make any progress
whatever, the scientist must make the supreme sacrifice of
attempting to deal only with specific isolable factors apparently
small and remote in themselves. The situation is analogous to
that of purely physical features. It is generally admitted that
the structure of the physical organism is heritable. But when
we show that the color of the eyes of the fruit fly is heritable
and that this inheritance takes place in a very complicated way,
as has been adequately shown, we have simply identified parts
of the structure and function of the genes in one specific feature
in the vastly complex physical organism, however fundamental
and characteristic this particular feature may be. This analogy
applies in principle to the genetic study of the musical life. The
crux of the difficulty lies in the identification of heritable factors.</p>

<p class='c014'>Again we must remember that the musical mind is first of all
a normal mind, a normal psychophysical organism ready to begin
to function immediately after birth. What we shall look for then
in a psychophysical organism is the presence of certain resources
especially favorable or especially unfavorable to the normal
functioning of the musical mind. We may assume that an
average capacity present in the genetic constitution may be adequate
for musical purposes but that exceptionally gifted persons
require these traits in a correspondingly exceptional degree and
that exceptionally unmusical individuals lack essential elements.
The most wonderful thing is that a person can come into the
world with a musical constitution at all, but the problem of
heredity centers around individual differences, and these are more
easily approachable than the total function. As in genetic studies
of the inheritance of color blindness it has been possible to identify
types, so in musical hearing we may look forward to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>identification of types of defect and types of superiority deviating
markedly from the normal.</p>

<p class='c014'>Common observation and reasoning convince us without
question that musicality is inherited in some mysterious way and
this follows also from general considerations of current theories
of biological inheritance. But when it comes to the scientific
determination of laws of such inheritance, we face high barriers.
Biological laws of inheritance must be established in terms of the
genes; a specific biological structure or function must be related
to gene organization. Let us call this measurement of the first
order. Such measurements are most readily applied to anatomical
structure and physiological function in the neuro-muscular organism.
This is notably clear in the anatomy and physiology of the ear
and its connections. It is equally applicable to the anatomy and
physiology of the vocal organs&mdash;the bellows, the vibrators and
the resonators for voice. It is conceivable, for example, that the
length, the mass, the mode of attachment, and the general position
and shape of the vocal cords and the mounting of the voice
box are heritable characters traceable to genes and referable to
musicality as the physical organs for voice.</p>

<p class='c014'>We can also find relationships to the endocrines, which are in
large part the determinants of musical emotionality. Electro-physiology
is now giving great promise for the identification of
functions in the ear and the brain and its central connections and is
establishing interrelationships. Many of the laws of heredity
established by measurements of this order probably refer to fundamental
biological principles of inheritance in the psychophysical
organism as a whole. By a physiological analysis of the sensory,
motor, and central factors which operate most significantly in
music, the systematist can set up a respectable body of biological
facts in regard to musical inheritance which are antecedently
probable in terms of the functions of genes and result in the
structure and function of the musical organism.</p>

<p class='c014'>Since the medium of music is sound, we shall look first for an
exceptionally responsive or unresponsive ear, including not only
the physical ear but the central organs in the nervous system
through which it functions. This is basic for two reasons: First,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>because it determines what stimulation from the world of sound
shall enter into the experience of the musical individual to a high
degree; and second, because the purely physiological receptivity or
organic response to sound acts upon and modifies the state of
well-being or ill-being according as the auditory impression is
beneficent or noxious in so far as its acts upon our circulation,
metabolism, temperature and other organic processes. Such well-being
or ill-being is, of course, in part the foundation for the
feeling of musical pleasures and pains.</p>

<p class='c014'>If we would gain a true and comprehensive insight into the
nature and extent of role of environment in musical life, we must
start with some established facts or reasonable assumptions of
what is "given" for environment to act upon. The heritage is the
capital fund which the environment invests or squanders. Only
by knowing the hereditary contributions can we appraise the environmental
contributions. In the study of the fruit fly, for
example, the revelations of factors which must be regarded as
environmental are quite as significant and essential as the revelations
about the original organization of genes. The determination
of the limits of heredity is the best means for revealing the functions
and possibilities of environment. The music geneticist will
therefore learn fully as much about environmental influences as he
will about hereditary influences in studying heredity.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>PSYCHOPHYSICAL MEASUREMENTS</h3>

<p class='c016'>The music geneticist can approach many significant aspects of
the subject through psychophysical experiments for which we now
have fairly standardized procedures. For the present purpose, we
may call this measurement of the second order as compared with
the anatomical and physiological measurements. It proceeds out
of, and is a complement to, the anatomical and physiological
foundations and probably represents the most fundamental approach
from the psychological and musical points of view. These
measurements deal primarily with sensitivity and discrimination
on the sensory side and the corresponding processes on the motor
side. Among them we may recognize two levels: The simple or
elemental, in which a specific mental process is related to a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>relatively specific organic basis; and the complex, which relates to
co-operative functions of the elemental capacities. Of the former
we have four; namely, the sense of pitch, the sense of loudness,
the sense of time, and the sense of timbre&mdash;each of which is correlated
with a specific attribute of the sound wave, which is the
musical medium. We have basic measurements of the hearing of
rhythm, consonance, volume, and sonance&mdash;all of which represent
relatively complex patterns. Each of these complex functions has
a unitary character. Rhythm, for example, is not merely time
plus intensity; it possesses a unitary character. Because of the
difficulty of dealing with the complex patterns, precedence should
be given to the four elemental or basic capacities. Excellence in
these capacities contributes toward ear-mindedness, of which the
auditory image is the most specific characteristic; but at the
present time we have no adequate objective method for the measuring
of auditory imagery.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the motor side we have corresponding measurements of
speed and accuracy in the motor control of each of these factors
represented in the sound wave; namely, frequency, amplitude,
duration, and form.</p>

<p class='c014'>The term elemental should be used with caution because we
never encounter a purely elemental state or process. Even in the
very simplest form they are merely more or less specific phases of
the mental organism; and at any level at which they are observable
they probably involve environmental accretions. It is the old
story: We never experience pure sensation but meaningful perception.
Yet under the most careful experimental control the
identification of such specific functions may be reasonably reliable
and have considerable validity.</p>

<p class='c014'>Adequate measurements of the sense of timbre are new and
therefore have not been employed extensively up to date. But the
sense of pitch, the sense of time, and the sense of loudness, together
with the sense of rhythm and immediate tonal memory,
have been used extensively.</p>

<p class='c014'>The significance of such measurements depends upon the
rigidity of the scientific technique and the selection of subjects
for experiment. Reliable measurements have been made on a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>variety of groups and for different purposes more or less related
to the problem of inheritance. Studies have been made upon
musically precocious children to determine to what degree they
were gifted in each of these capacities. All the available blood
relatives of six of the foremost musical families in America and a
number of such families in European countries have been investigated.
These capacities have been measured in selected virtuosi
in various fields of music. The measurements have been used for
the determination of qualifications for musical organizations and
for the analysis of admissions to music schools. Simplified forms
of the measurements have been made upon very young children
in musical families. Numerous cases of failure in musical education
have been investigated and often explained on the basis of
presence or absence of these basic capacities. Surveys have been
made on groups representing highly-privileged or under-privileged
children in the matter of musical facilities. Some of these
measures are now a part of the standard tests and measures
administered in the public schools so that comparisons can be
made with blood relatives, and data are becoming cumulative for
scientific comparison of successive generations. Numerous racial
studies have been made on a large scale, comparing these capacities,
for example, in different degrees of race mixture&mdash;as in the
transition from pure blacks through mulattoes to whites in a large
Negro community, or the comparison of racial groups in Hawaii,
the school children in different European countries, Indians with
whites, and distinctive races and primitive peoples in different
parts of the world.</p>

<p class='c014'>From this large array of facts certain findings seem to be
significant, taking these measurements as a group. First, the
sense of pitch, the sense of loudness, and the sense of time reveal
no distinctly significant differences in racial groups, in culture-levels,
or at age-levels, when adequately measured. In many cases
this holds also for the sense of rhythm and tonal memory. This is
probably indicative of the fact that the basic capacities for hearing
in individuals now living and capable of being tested adequately
are physiologically at the same level. This conclusion is in harmony
with the observation that these capacities which function in music,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>function also in the vast varieties of orientation through sound at
all levels of man now living. It is also analogous to what has
been found in vision. Second, it develops that in each and every
one of the groups studied there are enormous individual differences
in each of these capacities and that the extent and distribution
of these differences do not differ significantly from what
we find in the public school children of the United States. Third,
where comparisons of capacity and achievement have been made
reliably, it has been found that those who have achieved distinction
in music have these capacities in a significantly corresponding
degree; but much larger numbers of those possessing superior
capacity who have not been discovered as musical, either by themselves
or in their environment, are revealed. This fact rules out
many of the statistical studies of heredity in terms of musical
achievement. Fourth, these capacities represent relatively independent
factors in hearing. Fifth, marked superiority or inferiority
in these capacities is of predictive value for musical
achievement and guidance in education.</p>

<p class='c014'>On the motor side but little progress has been made. Principally
because the measurements are laborious, significant elements
have not been identified, and moderate motor capacities in
speed and action are adequate for most musical achievements.
Daily observations reveal that children may be slow and accurate,
slow and erratic, fast and accurate, or fast and erratic in various
degrees and combinations. It would, however, be of musical
significance to discover to what extent and in what manner these
traits are inherited from generation to generation.</p>

<p class='c014'>In view of these discoveries, it is evident that there is some
material available for technically rigid genetic interpretation in
terms of currently recognized principles of inheritance. All the
records on the six foremost musical families of America are
available in the confidential files of the Carnegie Institution, at
Cold Spring Harbor. Highly reliable measurements on all the
students in the Eastman School of Music for the last fifteen
years are available. Various public schools have vast cumulative
data, and elaborate collections are being worked upon in the
Winderen Laboratory, at Oslo. But with the exception of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>Carnegie Institution and the Oslo collections, adequate measurements
of whole families are absent.</p>

<p class='c014'>What is needed now is a thoroughly reliable series of measurements
on entire musical families and the interpretation of these
by a thoroughly competent geneticist in terms of established
biological principles of inheritance. It is especially important that
both parties shall be competent to take into account the numerous
lessons which we have learned from the extensive efforts that
have been made in the attempt to measure the inheritance of any
mental trait, such as human intelligence. In the human situation
we cannot breed successive generations rapidly, as in flies or mice,
for experimental purposes. We must, therefore, economize time
and effort by taking the most readily available material. For this
purpose I have suggested three possible methods (<i>Psychology of
Music</i>, McGraw-Hill, 1938). The first is that we start with the
highest 10 per cent and the lowest 10 per cent in an adequate
sampling of fifth-grade children in a school system and work
back by making the same measurements on the available blood
relatives of these two groups. In effective organization much
time can be saved by making group measurements in a co-operating
community, such as a city ward. A second procedure would be
to secure an adequate sampling of musicians and measure forward
and backward to cover three generations in which the matings
of musical and unmusical parents could be traced. A third
procedure would be a systematic collection of measurements on
school children for a generation or more giving special attention
to the showing of blood relatives. We cannot, however, stress too
strongly the importance of having these measurements made
throughout by an experimenter thoroughly competent in this
field and the equally thorough biological treatment of data by
scientists thoroughly competent in that specific field. If a biologist
wants to start the ball rolling from his point of view, the records
in the Eugenics Record office of the Carnegie Institution furnish a
fair and reliable sampling.</p>

<p class='c014'>In proposing this conservative approach through psychophysical
measurements, I do not wish to belittle the insight,
common knowledge and theories of inheritance which have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>obtained by observation and statistics in terms of musicality as a
whole&mdash;as in biography, autobiography and letters of great musicians
or in the study of musical families. But we are confronted
with the fact that these deal largely with unanalyzed situations so
completely covered by factors of environment and training as to
make them useless for strictly scientific purposes. Nor would I
belittle the significance of general traits, such as musical intelligence,
creative imagination and the artistic temperament, or
facilities for specific skills, such as sight reading, and the memorizing
of repertoires. We know a great deal about these and
unquestionably have the right to assume that they have an hereditary
basis. But scientific studies in heredity may be more properly
approached through the simpler and more elementary capacities.</p>

<p class='c014'>For scientific purposes, we cannot, of course, mix basic
measurements and current ratings of musical achievement. There
have been numerous approaches to this subject from the musical-achievement
point of view, and these have furnished many suggestive
leads and probably point to unquestioned facts about the
inheritance of musical talent. But the science of genetics rightly
rests upon and demands the isolation of specific factors which
can be measured; and for that purpose the musical geneticist
must, for the present, sacrifice many otherwise interesting approaches
from the point of view of rated achievement and be
willing to await the laying of foundations of rigidly conducted
measurements which can be described, interpreted, and verified.</p>

  <h2 class='c006'><i>Chapter VII</i><br />THE FUTURE OF MUSICAL INSTRUMENTS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Are we nearing the end of the "horse-and-buggy" stage of
musical instruments? Can the possibilities for revolutionary
procedures now looming up in the construction of musical instruments
be as strategic for music as were the principles embodied in
the coming of the automobile and the airplane for transportation?
Those of us who remember that faithful animal and servant of
man, the horse, and the conveyances he served, look back with
fond appreciation upon what amounted to a sort of fellowship
with a fine-performing animal and the luxury of being conveyed
by him in saddle or on wheel. So future generations may look
back upon the past in fond memories of the companionship they
have enjoyed with their favorite instruments, which may be
destined to a niche in the historical museum. But in spite of
competition, the horse has survived, and so probably will the fiddle
and some of its companion instruments.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is now safe to predict that the future instrument maker will
be able to produce any sound now known in nature or in art that
may possibly have musical significance. We already have at hand
the means by which any such sound can be adequately defined,
described, specified, measured, analyzed, and reconstructed. And
there is reason to think that with the conquest of new and marvelous
resources for musical media, musical composition will move
with strides in step with instrument building.</p>

<p class='c014'>The musical devotee is, therefore, facing new issues, thrilling
and possibly heart-rending. Can a musician adapt himself to
these changes? Will he tolerate modifications of old instruments,
radically new creations of instruments, revolutionary new types
of ensembles, and radically new types of musical creation? Can
musicians adapt themselves to these new musical media and musical
forms as rapidly and completely as we have adapted ourselves
to the transition from horse and buggy to automobile and airplane
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>within the span of less than half a century? The answer is probably
"no", for good reasons. Yet, sooner or later, the transition
will come in the form of new musical media, new musical composition,
and new types of musical appreciation and attachment.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>POSSIBLE LINES OF DEVELOPMENT</h3>

<p class='c016'>We can now foresee that musical instruments will be submitted
to critical analysis, with improvements even on the very
best; that substitute forms in great variety may be developed for
any now available musical instrument; that new instruments will
be designed for the production of new tone qualities and other
musical effects; that new ensembles may be built for any number
or kind of instrument, so that it is within the bounds of possibility
that the entire performance of the symphony orchestra, the
symphonic band, and the grand opera may be performed through
a single instrument operated by less than half a dozen persons;
that the transmission of music by remote control of the instrument
has extraordinary possibilities; that a vastly superior control
of tone for precision and modulation can be realized; that
the cost of musical instruments may be greatly reduced; that the
number of players needed in ensemble performance may be reduced,
since, on the analogy of the pipe-organ player, one individual
may perform for an entire orchestra; that current music
which has been hampered by limitations of the instrument may
be perfected and new types of music may be introduced; that the
musical instrument may become a medium for the production as
well as the reproduction of song and speech; that the musical
tone may be associated with other esthetic appeals, such as visual
presentation of color, relief, and dramatic action&mdash;these are all
within the realm of possible predictability.</p>

<p class='c014'>The range of possibilities may be illustrated in the case of a
generator for a single tone. A few years ago a graduate student
came to me and said that he wanted to take as the subject for his
doctoral dissertation the building of an electrical organ. I told
him that if he would build a generator for a single key I would
assure him a stipend for three years and all the needed facilities
of the Iowa acoustical laboratories. He accepted and made good
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>to an extraordinary degree. The tone generator he built is composed
of the first sixteen partials, <i>i. e.</i>, a fundamental and fifteen
overtones in harmonic series, each virtually a single pure tone.
The number of partials, the form of distribution of partials, the
amount of energy contributed by each partial, the phase relationships
of the partials, and the fundamental pitch are under control
and may be set up in any combination. With this number of
variables, mathematicians will say that any desired tone quality
of harmonic structure up to more than a million kinds of tone
can be produced. The ear cannot hear all these differences, but the
instrument provides keys for as many steps in the entire series as
may be musically significant, and the tone at each of these steps
can be specified for production, described, and repeated indefinitely.
Thus, it is possible to make the instrument speak any vowel
in so far as it involves harmonic structure, and the harmonic
composition of any musical instrument may be imitated. Provision
for inharmonic elements and noise accessories which are
necessary both for vowels and instruments can, of course, be
installed with this generator. Given one tone with such a range
of possibilities, it is but a series of logical and fairly simple steps
to provide a complete musical instrument by simply multiplying
notes of this kind. This is the type of development we see now in
a variety of electronic instruments.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The improvement of existing instruments.</i> Musical instruments
now in use can be improved. We now have the means for
the technical analysis of the character of the tone produced by
any instrument as a whole or by any particular feature in its
construction, so that faults and limitations can be definitely allocated.
Recent investigations have revealed faults in the best of
violins. Some of these faults or limitations may be corrected by
change in construction. For practical purposes, a 1939 violin of
American make may approximate the good qualities of the
Stradivarius, and there is no doubt that improvements could be
made upon the famous old instrument. The same is true in principle
of all individual musical instruments now in use. One of the
obstacles, however, will be the unwillingness of many musicians to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>face the innovation of change in the looks of their beautiful instruments
so tenderly loved and guarded.</p>

<p class='c014'>The piano, as we now have it, has limitations and defects,
some of which can be reduced or eliminated by the adoption of
new principles of action and activation, and by construction according
to acoustical specifications, based upon the measurement
of the effect of each feature upon qualitative and dynamic values
of tones. For example, the characteristic tone of the piano as
distinguished from most other instruments comes to a dynamic
peak immediately after the hammer stroke and falls off rapidly.
We have learned to make allowance for this so that in hearing
music we have a tendency to hear a quarter note as of a given
even loudness although the sound fades off sharply during that
period. It is well known that with the drop in the loudness of the
tone there is a corresponding change in the quality of the tone,
which change again we have, of necessity, practically learned to
ignore. If it should prove desirable, it is now quite easy to provide
a mechanism which will sustain the piano tone at even loudness,
and therefore uniform tone quality, during the time value assigned
to it. The distribution of resonances of the instrument can be
greatly improved by balancing. The necessary mechanical noises
which accompany the production of tone in a piano may be
largely eliminated if that should prove desirable. The acoustical
engineer can now point out dozens of features in the piano which
might be improved in future construction based upon analysis of
the output in sound. In the same manner the organ, the king of
instruments, if it is to maintain its pre-eminence in competition
with substitutes, demands improvements in the light of new
facilities. The more complicated the instrument, the more possibilities
there are for improvement. During the last hundred years
there has been a steady betterment in the mechanisms of practically
all the leading musical instruments; but this movement will rise
to great heights in view of the new tools for investigation and
new materials and principles of construction.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>New substitutes for existing instruments.</i> Substitutes for all
instruments now extant may be expected to come mainly through
the development of electrical construction, although many forms
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>of mechanical devices may be used independently or with the
electrical. There is no question at all but that with such resources,
substitutes for a stringed instrument, a wood wind, a horn, and
many varieties of traps and accessories can be built so as to
embody increased musical resources. The principles for the construction
of such a violin, flute, trumpet, or any other single instrument
are already in hand. The construction may embody such
mechanical devices as strings, membranes, and pipes; but if so,
these will be electrically energized. We may predict that substitutes
for single instruments will increase in great variety and
that very simple forms adapted to age and advancement in the playing
of specific instruments can be supplied. The variety of means
for stunt performances may be increased to an alarming degree.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>New ensembles.</i> Another significant line of development will
undoubtedly appear in the matter of ensembles. By the utilization
of electrical construction, a single series of generators may supply
the harmonic structure of a tone from each and every instrument
now in use. Thus, a bank of sixteen violins may be supplied from
this single source and sixteen individual violin tones may be played
in identical pitch, even dynamics, equal temporal movements, and
uniform tone quality. Such uniformity would however be of
limited musical significance. The important thing musically is the
fact that in such a bank any desired form of artistic deviation or
differential enrichment may be provided for. The same would
apply to wood winds, horns, bells, drums and other percussion
instruments in large part. Where further representation of mixed
tone, inharmonics, or noises are demanded, they may be added.
The substitute for a drum can increase the precision and range of
the drum sound without the use of the drum, as, for example, in
the present "<a id='corr66.30'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='Novacord'>Novachord</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_66.30'>Novachord</a></span>". Thus, it is conceivable that with the
exception of certain unforeseen limitations, the instrumentation of
an entire orchestra or band can be built into a single unit operated
from a single console.</p>

<p class='c014'>From what we have seen in the way of marvelous demonstrations
in recent years it is reasonable to suppose that entirely new
types of complex instruments will be invented, bringing to music
hitherto unknown resources. Furthermore, with the instrumental
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>music as such, provision may be made in the instruments for
words in speech and song, and the visual presentation of dramatic
action in color, relief, and movement which may be controlled
from the console. The goal of embodying in a single instrument
or coupling units of instruments the means of performing chamber
music, orchestra, band, and the grand opera, is without doubt no
wilder prediction than was the prediction of radio or airplane a
few years ago.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>NEW MUSIC</h3>

<p class='c016'>The improvement of old instruments and the introduction of
new ones will call for an unprecedented revision of old music
and a creation of new. When music was written for the well-tempered
clavichord it was limited to the resources of that instrument.
The same is true of music for all instruments. The music
had to be limited to the available resources of the instrument. It
is reasonable to suppose that composers will respond from time
to time with up-to-date adaptations and new creations, taking
advantage of each of the new resources for range of pitch and
loudness and new resources for variety in harmony and richness
of tone. It is equally conceivable that the composer may set up
new demands to which the inventor and instrument maker may
respond on call. It is difficult to realize what extraordinary enrichment
in musical resources may spring up under the impetus
of new instrumental resources. There will be new treatments of
scales and intervals, since the pitch control will be far more flexible
than it has been. Perhaps one of the largest innovations will be in
the freer use of intonation not built on any particular scale but
soaring with the greatest freedom on an instrument as we now
hear it, for example, in the singing of Negro spirituals. Performance
scores show that these natural singers defy scales, but produce
beautiful effects through their free and soaring pitch
inflection. Stringed instruments have been hampered by accompaniment
and by tradition and theory. We can anticipate significant
developments outside of our diatonic scale which has come
to be a sort of strait-jacket, at least theoretically. It has been
shown, for example, that a quarter-tone instrument is not of
much use unless music is written not only for these intervals but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>in modes, themes, and atmosphere adapted to such purpose. The
pitch range of the composition will be extended; so also will the
dynamic range. Countless new features can be introduced for
enrichment of tone and variety of harmony. Nomenclature will
develop so that the composer may not only think in definable
terms but may be able to inject new elements of terminology into
the score. For various types of ensembles the music will, of
course, have to be written or adapted specifically. Stunt music
will here find unlimited opportunities for novelty and escape from
conventional tone. This may give us relief from the limitations of
jazz and swing, which have been so boring in recent years. There
will undoubtedly be great bewilderment as to the limits of tolerance
for new media and new forms for musical creations. History
has revealed clearly that the adaptation of taste and tolerance
requires time, and conservatism is often a beneficent safeguard.</p>

<p class='c014'>The most fundamental recent achievement in the building of
new instruments is that of producing pure tones as well as rich
tones in perfect harmonic structure without accessories. But for
various reasons music has always utilized more or less inharmonic
structures and has imitated, or at least tolerated, noises in the
forms of hisses, twangs, and all kinds of inharmonic and noisy
distortion. Recourse to discord will always be demanded in music;
but it is a question as to what extent aperiodic sounds or noises
are necessary. We have learned to accept the hisses, scratches,
rattles, thuds, and bangs of countless varieties in musical tone.
Some such accretions are present in the tone production of every
instrument now in use. They have arisen as impediments in construction,
but have come to be accepted as characteristics of the
instrument and therefore have added greatly to the individuality
of each instrument. Will the future musical public insist on
having these or will there be a feeling of relief when we can get
rid of them? The answer is probably in the middle ground because
music, at least as we know it now, calls for a great variety of
noises in the interest of realism. Possibly in the future, noise
may be given a chastened and more honorable place in the family
of tone qualities.</p>

<p class='c014'><span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>The significant thing to note here is that in new types of instruments
any kind of crude sound or noise can be introduced at
will. This will answer the purpose of program music in that perfectly
realistic reproductions can be made of the sound of steps
in marching, the slam of a door, the squeal of a pig, the bleat of
a lamb, the crow of a rooster, the roar of an airplane, the sigh of
the wind. A comparatively small outfit of sources for accessory
noises can serve a great variety of purposes in the hands of the
artist. New responsibilities for the composer in these respects
may be foreseen.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>PLAYING</h3>

<p class='c016'>As in the automobile, for example, the tendency is to make
everything automatic and relieve the human control of effort,
we are moving fast in the direction of creating automatic devices
in musical instruments. It is safe to predict that a variety of
instruments for children will be more easily played than at
present, and that even for the virtuoso a number of the factors
which have been difficult to control will be simplified and mechanized.
This will be particularly true in ensemble instruments
where a single player may control a large number of instruments
or where three or four players, of whom one is the conductor,
may render the equivalent of an orchestral performance. Barring
the limitations of the instrument it is significant that in such performance
the conductor will have vastly superior control of the
situation in that he is in direct manual control of all those factors
which in the present orchestra he tries to control through the
medium of the individuals and masses of players with the baton
as a sort of whip. In the new orchestra, he will sit at a panel with
levers and buttons through which he will be able to control the
interpretation he desires to make.</p>

<p class='c014'>This conducting may be done with meticulous precision and
apparently magical result through remote control, as was illustrated,
even with the use of present instruments, when Stokowski
sat at his panel in Washington, D. C. and controlled the performance
of his orchestra in Philadelphia.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>
  <h3 class='c015'>SPECIFICATIONS FOR INSTRUMENT CONSTRUCTION</h3>
</div>

<p class='c016'>The musical medium whether in art or nature has four, and
only four, elements; namely, pitch, loudness, time, and timbre.
These are four characteristics which may be expressed in terms
of the sound wave, as frequency of waves, intensity of waves,
duration of waves, and form of waves. The recognition of this
fact vastly simplifies the mastery of tone production in musical
instruments. Let us consider the factors which may be classified
under these four heads.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Pitch.</i> New devices for the control of pitch make possible
very superior control of the pitch in pitch precision, flexibility,
linearity, range, varieties of scale, and harmony. Instruments can
be tuned to a higher degree of precision, retuned more quickly,
and kept in tune longer by the new means of tone production.
Therefore, intervals can be made more exact, the pitch can be
sustained with precision, any pitch aspect can be described, desired
effects can be specified, and artistic adjustments can be made for
musical effect.</p>

<p class='c014'>Any desired type of flexibility may be introduced, such as the
gliding attack and release, periodic or progressive changes in a
sustained tone, as in the vibrato, or rise and fall in tone required
during the sounding of a single note. The glide, the portamento,
and a variety of other pitch ornaments may be produced. Adjustments
from any size of intervals for artistic effect, such as a
quarter tone or enlarged or diminished intervals, may be produced.
In short, the pitch inflection can be controlled either within
a single note or a sequence of notes, and just intonation or tempered
scales of various sorts may be produced. The possibility of
combining individual notes in harmony is unlimited. The pitch
range of the instruments can be carried to any height above the
present gamut of instruments, even into the region of supersonics,
which may possibly have physical effects on the feeling of
well-being or ill-being of the musical organism.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Loudness.</i> The range of loudness can be extended both in the
direction of increased loudness and perfectly controlled softness.
The loudness of tones throughout the entire range can be equalized.
All forms of dynamic shading and fading and differential
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>steps of loudness can be introduced for artistic effect. The dynamic
linearity, as in the organ, can be sustained and the fading effect,
which distinguishes the piano from the organ, can be
adjusted to any degree. All present pedals as well as new pedals
may be introduced.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Time.</i> Through the precision made possible for various forms
of automatic action in the instrument, all temporal aspects of
tone can be enhanced by precision, controlled tapering at the
beginning and end of the tone, various forms of synchronization,
and the balancing of the roles of time and stress in rhythm may
be achieved.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Timbre.</i> The most significant new feature is, of course, the
extension and control of richness in timbre and sonance, which
constitute tone quality. The range of timbre changes may extend
from a pure tone to the inclusion of even more partials than the
ear can hear, possibly thirty or forty, with an infinite variety of
harmonic forms of distribution between these extremes. Great
innovations through inharmonic and aperiodic sounds are coming.
It is now possible to maintain a uniform timbre which gives
an element of dignity and stability to the tone in a sustained note.
But since deviation from the regular is of far greater importance,
<a id='corr71.23'></a><span class='htmlonly'><ins class='correction' title='flexibilty'>flexibility</ins></span><span class='epubonly'><a href='#c_71.23'>flexibility</a></span> of tone quality is even more desirable. This flexibility in
timbre for the duration of the tone which determines tone quality,
technically called sonance, may be provided for by various devices.
For example, in the present "Novachord", the various forms and
degrees of vibrato are at the command of the player and are
based on scientific investigation leading to specification for this
musical ornament. Given the mechanisms for harmonic structures
and inharmonics, we need only the addition of rough noise of
various kinds to make the tone realistic. The timbre available in
the musical instrument will therefore run from the pure tone to
the roughest noise.</p>

<p class='c014'>In the above I have attempted to present a picture in rough
outline indicating present trends and predictable futures for music
through the improvement of musical instruments. The instrumentalist
can point out many features not here mentioned. The
musician may yearn for new resources in his musical medium for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>which he can now lay down specifications. The listeners must be
prepared for startling innovations and thrilling new sources of
pleasure in music. It will take generations to finish the theoretical
picture I have here sketched in bold outline&mdash;but let us look forward
to a progressive unveiling and revelation of possibilities.
But take no alarm&mdash;the horse, if not the buggy, will survive.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>
  <h2 class='c006'><i>CHAPTER VIII</i><br />PRAISE AND BLAME IN MUSIC</h2>
</div>

<p class='c013'>Music is unique among esthetic appeals in that it demands
immediate response in the form of praise or blame. The
orator demands immediate response; but his appeal is to reasoning,
not to feeling. The painter, sculptor, and poet demand
esthetic response, but this response is delayed and does not keep
the artist on the tip of his nerves to receive it. The musical appeal
is all the more emotional because it is not only an appeal for
personal recognition but for the aggrandizement of the noble
art. The musician at all ages and all stages of advancement can
perform for his own pleasure in isolation, but even here the
demand for praise or blame on the spur of the moment is emphatic
and essential.</p>

<p class='c014'>It is, of course, fully recognized that at his best the musical
performer is not conscious of making a direct appeal for approval
by others. His objective is rather that of self-expression and
experiment in the execution of an artistic skill. He is often aware
of a negative attitude in his audience, and he may take an attitude
of aloofness or superiority toward the audience, recognizing its
incompetence. Yet back of it all, there may be even a distant hope
of approval in a coming generation or the critical judgment of
the select few; but the attitude of the immediate audience or the
public toward his performance plays heavily upon his unanalyzed
feelings and moods.</p>

<p class='c014'>The bases for musical praise and blame are notoriously inadequate,
be they meaningless approval, empty flattery, or censorious
criticism. A general attitude of spontaneous approval without
knowing or giving reasons among listeners in general is praiseworthy
as an expression of good will; but for serious purposes
we must question the competence of the listener for the response
manifested. The fault may lie in the listener's ignorance of the
art of music, his incompetence in recognizing elements of merit,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>his failure to credit the performer in relation to natural ability or
purpose. Praise or blame may also carry or miscarry in so far as
it may wisely serve to motivate or discourage the performer on the
specific issues involved in the performance. With the sudden
popularizing of music, the incoming tendency is to associate music
with the beginning of a scientific approach to the understanding
of the music and the musician. This situation is changing at a
gratifying rate for the good of music. It is worth while to consider
in some detail the factors in this progress.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>VANTAGE GROUNDS</h3>

<p class='c016'><i>Artistic insight.</i> The extraordinarily rapid introduction of real
music education in the grades and in the high school and college
curricula, and even in graduate study, is changing the attitude of
the listener by increasing his competence. Children and youth
now hear more good music and hear it presented in such a way as
to increase their understanding of it. At the college level music is
presented as an academic subject, with primary emphasis upon
the art of hearing music together with some knowledge of history
and content of music. The training of high-school teachers of
music has changed radically in a generation from the mere
development of proficiency with an instrument or voice to a deeper
insight into the nature of the art, its history, and its roles. At
many levels well-developed courses in music appreciation have
acquired a permanent status and have proved a good foundation
for further penetration into the art of the appreciation of music.
This implanting of points of view and development of esthetic
attitudes in the academic instruction in the schools is hastened to
fruitage by the popularizing of music for the masses through
radio and phonograph as well as through the penetrating of the
skills acquired in school into the home and social institutions.
The popularizing of good music, where public entertainment in
the parks and other public places is of good musical quality and
furnished free or at popular prices, is a great help in developing a
critical attitude even among those in other respects quite uneducated.
Therefore, we may say with great satisfaction that training
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>in the art of hearing music has come upon the educational horizon
in America in a very promising way.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The scientific attitude.</i> We are constantly impressed with the
analogy between scientific insight into the nature of music and
the corresponding insight in other sciences, such as botany or
astronomy. A child starts out with an inborn capacity and urge
for the love of flowers; but as a student of flowers he soon encounters
many marvelous revelations. On the one hand his horizon
is broadened by acquaintance with larger and larger classes
and varieties. He learns to see relationships to habitat. He learns
to trace scientifically the laws of their evolution, the methods of
artificial breeding and development of new plants, and even the
beauty in their usefulness. On the other hand, he turns to his
microscope and discovers not only the external parts visible to
the naked eye but the internal structures, their modes of evolution
and development, even down to the discovery of the mechanisms of
heredity through the genes, which are so small that we know them
only by inference from what the microscope reveals. The natural
history of music is analogous to that of such a material science.</p>

<p class='c014'>This scientific insight into the structure and function of music
goes hand in hand with the development of the artistic insight
into the nature of the esthetic values from the point of view of
the art of music. Thus the student of music is now furnished the
facilities for increasing his power of appreciation of music and a
critical awarding of praise or blame from two complementary points
of view: a study of the art and a study of the science of music.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Terminology.</i> The mere matter of terminology here plays a
very important role, as is now being demonstrated so successfully
in the recent developments in the field of psychology of music
and acoustics. Take, for example, the concept of tone quality.
Until a few years ago there was probably not a single adequate
statement of the nature of tone quality in the entire literature on
music; and yet this is the most important element in music. In
the past the listener and the student have generally approached
the subject in an attitude of acceptance or rejection of the unanalyzed
impression, but often with no more competence than
that with which the ignorant shepherd appraises the grandeur and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>meaning of the heavens above on a starlit night. The teacher, as a
rule, said "This is beautiful," or "This is ugly," without being
able to give the reasons why, for want of a tangible terminology.
The teaching and development of tone quality therefore has
wallowed in a slough of despond. Recent researches in the field
of musical acoustics are ushering in a new era. The structure of
tone quality has been dissected, and its parts have been adequately
described and defined. This is leading to an improved musical
language. The same is true for other musical concepts. Thus,
through the systematic development of musical terminology, there
will gradually develop a scientific classification of the various
aspects of the musical medium which is essential not only for the
learning of music but also for the awarding of praise and blame.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>Musical talent.</i> With this development of a knowledge of the
nature of music, the scientific student of music has turned to the
analysis of the nature of the musical mind attempting to assign
specific roles to musical heredity and musical training and environment.
Hazy concepts of the gift of music have been subjected
to scientific analysis, experiment, and measurement. From
this, it is being demonstrated that it is impossible to award praise
or blame without taking a reasonable account of the innate fortes
and faults of the performer which determine in large part the
direction and limits of achievement or failure. The recognition
of this fact, of course, plays its fundamental role in the early
encouragement or discouragement of the inceptive musician, in
the recognition of the purpose of his education, and in the motivation
through training.</p>

<h3 class='c015'>PARTIES CONCERNED</h3>

<p class='c016'><i>The pupil.</i> Modern education has revealed the importance of
a student-centered and student-originated learning process as
opposed to the traditional and institutional direction of development
of the individual. The question of self-praise and self-blame,
satisfaction or dissatisfaction on the part of the child or youth, is
of course of first importance both in the initial stages of orientation
and throughout the course of specialization and achievement.
Instead of imposing regimentation, the home, the school and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>private teachers tactfully aim to assist the child in the discovery
of his natural interests, resources and promises which aid him in
the building of his personal convictions. But emphasis is laid
upon the principle of self-determination in the light of progressively
available reasonable facilities for self-appraisal. This refers
both to the appreciation of music and to the development of
musical skills. This principle of self-determination has frequently
run amuck in the hands of progressive educators, capital <i>P</i>. But
it is a fundamental and permanent principle for the development
of personality and motivation in specific pursuits. The child will
soon discover that in order to pursue his interests and satisfy
himself in performance he may have to work hard, conform to
requirements, be patient, and make sacrifices; but his first goal is
to feel satisfaction in what he is getting and in the worth-whileness
of the pursuit.</p>

<p class='c014'>For these things he will find an analogy in any form of play,
physical or mental, into which he enters in a wholehearted way.
This feeling of self-approbation comes easily in the musically
talented where the urge for music is clearly manifested; but with
moderate talent this attitude of self-reliance needs cultivation.
And in the assumed absence of talent, there is need of assistance in
the real verification of this absence. The greatest danger lies in the
intrusion of prejudice and social pressures. This principle of self-determination
is of most importance in those fields which are to
be pursued primarily as a source of self-expression and pleasure
in the pursuit as distinguished from the pursuits which are essential
for the earning of bread and butter and the maintaining of
social status.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The teacher.</i> The recognition of this principle of self-determination
and the sustained will to achieve has revolutionized the
art of teaching, or we may say better, has laid the beginnings for
an art of teaching. One of the greatest obstacles the teacher
encounters is the traditional social demand, and often the recognized
objective in the profession, to make everybody musical.
Finding that there is no adequate natural interest and no marks
of gratifying achievement are developing, the teacher settles
down to the sledge-hammer method of forced development. We
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>must therefore bespeak for the live music teacher the right to
refuse to make gold out of iron. The private teacher's fee and
the tuition of the school are, of course, the temptations of the
devil to face the situation with complacence. The constituency
granting lenience in this respect has the right to expect that, in
turn, the teacher understands and has exercised the effective means
of self-discovery, self-orientation, self-determination, and self-motivation
on the part of those who are on the border line. In
this art, the profession has made but little progress so far. The
constituency also has the right to impose the obligation upon the
teacher to respect the individuality of the gifted and to give all
types of freedom to the pupil commensurate with his natural line
and degree of successful achievement in developing appreciation
for various types of music.</p>

<p class='c014'>In breaking with the traditional routines of musical drill, the
teacher must first of all give up the attempt to cast the musical
mind of the child in the mold of his or her own pattern. This
principle has acquired its greatest significance in dealing with the
highly gifted, where it is clearly substantiated by the musical history
of precocious children. The public must acquire tolerance
for the principle of giving musical facilities to child and youth in
proportion to this self-determination and demonstrated ability to
achieve. The great musician and the musical virtuoso are not
fostered by educational or social conformance but primarily by
the enjoyment of the principle of free determination and development
of divergent personality.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The critic.</i> The music critic unfortunately, as a rule, is a
newspaper man and must conform to the pressure methods of
efficiency in writing down. This newspaper ability has often been
the basis for the unfortunate selection of musical critics. On the
other hand, the thoroughly competent musical critic, if he were to
ply his art as a technician, would find but small outlet for publication
and a negligible constituency of readers. He would face,
most discouragingly, the fact that many of the performers on the
stage do not have critical knowledge of what they are doing and
are not interested or even capable of reading the highly technical
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>and critical analysis of their performance. So we must be tolerant
with the musical critic.</p>

<p class='c014'>If music were a simple thing or had a specific goal, such as
the development of a logical proposition, the task of the critic
would be easier. But, as it is, he is dealing with a highly fluid
and chaotic state of affairs when he is supposed to aid the common
reader in assigning praise or blame to the performance. One
of the most striking faults of the work of the musical critic is
his lack of words&mdash;lack of concepts which are discriminating and
logically definable. We tolerate his splashing of his personal likes
or dislikes as if he were competent to boil down our feelings of
the situation into a fair assaying of praise or blame of the performance.
One difficulty lies in the demand for writing in smart
and emotional style. Among critics there are rare individuals who
have a fine artistic insight and a balanced esthetic judgment in
regard to what is good or bad in music. But we seldom see their
names in the musical-review columns.</p>

<p class='c014'>Phonophotographic recordings reveal art principles which
had not been discovered in the musical world through hearing,
and yet functioned very largely. They enable the critic to use
scientific language in the description of achievement and assign
praise or blame on the basis of identifiable and describable
grounds. We can now photograph the sound waves of a performance
at any distance from the source of sound and convert this
into an analyzable performance score. As a whole, this principle
cannot be available to the musical critic who must render an immediate
opinion. But we have a right to expect that he should
have a scientific knowledge of the types of facts which are revealed
in such objective records. He is living in a new musical era
in which the qualifications for the critic are as new as they are
for the artistic and scientific orientation of teacher and performer.</p>

<p class='c014'><i>The public.</i> I can recall the time when the possession of a
piano and piano lessons for the darling girl represented almost
the sole ambition of the mothers in our state aside from the
spontaneous and untutored self-expression in song. The public
demand has changed. Instruments have changed. Methods of
teaching have changed. Understanding of the art has increased.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>Cosmopolitan tastes have spread. Knowledge of the science of
music has become aligned with knowledge in other sciences. The
public rapidly learns to demand all these things and take the right
for granted. The ambition of the mother, the objective of the
teacher, and the expression of the youth of fifty years ago are
coming to be historical curiosities. The art of music in America is
coming to a wholesome fruitage and is becoming associated with
present-day academic learning. For the first time in history it
reaches out into the remotest corners of the land and many of the
technical aspects of the art and new concepts of the musical
medium are fast becoming common-sense knowledge and therefore
add in the just awarding of praise or blame.</p>

    </dd>
    <dt>(5)</dt>
    <dd>As every scientific discovery and invention gradually becomes common-sense knowledge when
    popularly known, so artistic judgment tends to crystallize into common-sense feeling.
    </dd>
    <dt>(6)</dt>
    <dd>Musical criticism may be chastized and chastened into balanced and critical judgment,
    relatively free from emotional explosions.
    </dd>
    <dt>(7)</dt>
    <dd>The spontaneous and natural smile or frown is often more eloquently telling or cutting
    than words.
    </dd>
    </dl>

<h4 class='c018'><i>Consider These Questions</i></h4>

 <dl class='dl_1 c005'>
    <dt>(1)</dt>
    <dd>Is the conventional response to music affectedly temperamental?
    </dd>
    <dt>(2)</dt>
    <dd>Why is listening intently to a major musical performance more exhausting than listening
    to an equally engrossing lecture on "International Relations?"
    </dd>
    <dt>(3)</dt>
    <dd>Was the English visitor right when he said, "You have no art, because whatever you have
    you display"?

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>
  <h4 class='c018'><i>Discuss This Situation</i></h4>
</div>

 <dl class='dl_1 c005'>
    <dt>(1)</dt>
    <dd>During the last twenty years in a Midwestern city of 30,000 people music has "come to
    town." Curricular and extracurricular music in the schools has been tenfold what it was
    during the foregoing twenty years. Music clubs and other musical activities have greatly
    increased. The community often takes as strong an interest in local, district, state, and
    national contests in music as ordinarily attaches to football. Discuss the effect of this
    upon (a) the musical, (b) the social, (c) the recreational and (d) the educational life
    of the community. Evaluate the change in interest and capacity for assigning fair praise
    and blame to music.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
